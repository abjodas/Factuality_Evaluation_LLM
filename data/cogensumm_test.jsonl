Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from. Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June. Manchester City's tenacious, \u00a0creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea) At 36 years old, he is no spring chicken, but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side. Tremmel has played second fiddle to Michel Vorm and then Lukasz Fabianski during his four years at Swansea, but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the Swans beat Bradford in the Capital One Cup final two years ago. Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel, 36, is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - Glen Johnson (Liverpool) England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool, but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer. Johnson, who has 54 England caps, is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books. England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup looks set to leave Liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - Kolo Toure (Liverpool) Another regular at Liverpool who is still to extend his contract. Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November, but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club. Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool . Centre-back - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows, especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him. Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season. At 30, he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams. Holland's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa . Left-back - Luke Garbutt (Everton) Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal, but he is yet to put pen to paper. The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere. Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he's yet to commit . Right wing - James Milner (Manchester City) Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer, Milner has 15 years' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps. Milner is both tenacious and creative, either in the centre of midfield or out wide, and he is still a year off his 30th birthday. Milner has 15 years in top flight experience, 53 England caps and still isn't 30, so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Named Arsenal captain last summer, but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury. Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return. May be 33, but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist. Mikel Arteta hasn't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin . Central midfield - Tom Cleverley (Manchester United) Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer, Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal. 'I think I'm going to be his type of player,' he said. But alas, that did not prove to be the case. The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa, where he has played 30 times. He is not wanted back at United. Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international. Unwanted by Manchester United, Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley . Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez (Newcastle) Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month, but is no longer wanted by his club. Will be 32 in the summer, but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him. Testicular cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere, even if it isn't Newcastle . Striker - Danny Ings (Burnley) One of a number of young English strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for Burnley this season. Rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United and their neighbours City, as well as David Moyes' Real Sociedad. Manchester United and City are said to be interested in Burnley's dangerous striker Danny Ings . Striker - James Wilson (Manchester United) Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under Ryan Giggs against Hull. The 19-year-old has played 16 times under Van Gaal, but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close, the United academy product is yet to agree terms.

There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence. Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women . The new powers, approved by Deputy Premier and Planning Minister Jackie Trad, means there is now an official and legal definition of a party house so the council can enforce laws to shut them down in certain areas.

If they refuse the council can legally shut them down. Party houses are just short-term accommodation options that people regularly rent out for rowdy events like Bucks parties.

I like wearing fitted dresses and showing my figure off. I\u2019d love her to get something more fashionable like a bob.' Miss Bredo admits she does not fancy Prince William and is not tempted to have her own happy ending like the royal couple.

Police are investigating whether the blaze is connected to two separate suspicious blazes that were lit two days before at St James Catholic Church in Brighton and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda, where paedophile priest Ronald Pickering served as minister. St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong\u00a0is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased Father Kevin O'Donnell . On April 1, it took firefighters 90 minutes to extinguish blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street in Dandenong. Father O'Donnell - who was reportedly known by police as the 'two-a-day man' - was jailed for 15 months in 1995 after he admitted to abusing\u00a010 boys and two girls. He is believed to have committed hundreds of sexual assaults against  young girls and boys over the 50 years that he worked in Victorian Catholic churches, before he retired in 1992. He died in 1997. At the Dandenong church in 1958 Father O'Donnell allegedly molested a 15-year-old boy in the presbytery and went on to sexually abuse his brother, sister and friends,\u00a0The Age reported. He presided over the church from 1958 to 1986, before moving onto Oakleigh. On March 30,\u00a0heritage-listed St James Catholic Church in Brighton was mostly destroyed by fire and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda was found with a small amount fire damage to a door. Bishop Peter Elliott told 3AW Catholic churches would be increasing their security, and said he did not believe the fires were lit by sex abuse victims. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths said she was 'quite elated' when she heard the 124-year-old James Catholic church  had been destroyed by fire. Firefighters extinguished blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street . The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church's former parishioners she found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the  building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it was left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by 'tragedy and complicated feelings' and described it as being known locally as 'the haunted house on the hill'. 'We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,' she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D'Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D'Brass said: 'Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. 'I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: 'I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. 'He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. 'One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.' Many of the church's former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. 'MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: 'You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.' 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos.\u00a0And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: 'Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.' Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails. The pipe organ by Alfred Fuller of Kew, placed centrally in the rear gallery, is a rare example of his work'. Investigators are keen to speak to anyone that may have seen any suspicious activity in the area. Police are urging anyone with information about the fire to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au to make a confidential report.", "claim": "police have released

Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau could be a glorious asset at the showpiece tournament after Australia\u2019s policy against picking players based abroad was relaxed this week, but one thing he can\u2019t do is anchor the scrum. The national coach refuses to bite back, but he has evidently noted and logged claims from these parts that his forwards will be cannon fodder for their English and Welsh rivals, amid the three-way tussle for qualification from daunting Pool A. Australia head coach Michael Cheika is aware that his pack is being written off for the World Cup . Cheika's side will face England and Wales in crunch pool games at the tournament in September . England's pack demolished Australia at scrum-time during last November's 26-17 victory at Twickenham . In fact, many of the claims have come from these pages. Speaking to Sportsmail from Sydney, Cheika repeatedly name-checked a certain knight of the realm and columnist of this newspaper, among the voices arguing that the green-and-gold pack will be smashed into submission. \u2018It has been pretty well reported here that Clive Woodward and others have said that England are going to take us apart in the forwards,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been hearing. I understand that they will have a lot of confidence in their forwards to take us on, but I think you discount the English backs at your peril, because they have some very powerful runners. In Ben Youngs, Care and Wigglesworth, they have three half-backs who will challenge the line every time. \u2018Joseph looks like a nice player and they\u2019ve got some good options in midfield now. Tuilagi will come back into it, they have Barritt too and big Sam (Burgess) might even get a run soon enough, as he grows into the game. Ford has done well for England at 10, they\u2019ve got fast wingers and I\u2019m a big fan of Mike Brown at full-back. There are a variety of threats that we will have to deal with.\u2019 Cheika\u2019s admiration for England\u2019s attacking runners behind the scrum is part of the former Leinster coach\u2019s overall assertion that the European nations are just as adept at playing an open game as their southern rivals, when conditions allow. But his repeated references to the pre-tournament dismissal of his pack suggest that there will be a strong emphasis on the set piece in particular during the World Cup countdown over the summer. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau (left) is set to feature for the Wallabies at the World Cup . \u2018Commentators in the UK are saying we won\u2019t be able to match it with England and Wales in the forwards,\u2019 he reiterated. \u2018They\u2019re saying that it\u2019s a shame to waste the talent in our backs. There\u2019s been a fair bit of that coming out, but we\u2019re working hard to make up ground in that area. \u2018Clive Woodward \u2013 who is not just your average spectator \u2013 says we won\u2019t be able to compete with the English scrum. For us, it\u2019s about having a clear philosophy about how we want to do it then practising a lot. We will aim to be at our best in every single scrum.\u2019 According to Cheika, the epic final day of this year\u2019s Six Nations \u2013 truly \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 \u2013 gave a vivid demonstration to viewers Down Under about the threat to the Wallabies from England and Wales. \u2018Both those sides are shaping up well,\u2019 he said. \u2018England will be on home soil and the Welsh will be much closer to home than we will be. I\u2019m sure they will be fancying their chances against us. Most people are looking at us as the ones who will be in the most trouble, but we will relish it and enjoy it. \u2018England and Wales will be feeling good about themselves after the Six Nations. The performance by Wales against Italy in their final game was incredible. I was watching it until it was 13-12 and it was the wee small hours here so I went to bed. When I woke up, they had won by 50! When they needed to, they were able to do that and that is very confidence-building.\u2019 As a long-standing fan of rugby league, Cheika is well aware of Sam Burgess\u2019s potential to make a major impact in his new code, once he has come through the transition phase. He is preparing for the Bath player to be unleashed against Australia; a country where he is revered in light of his title-winning exploits for the Rabbitohs in Sydney. Cheika has cited Ben Youngs (left) and Danny Care as dangerous No 9's who challenge the advantage line . Jonathan Joseph (second left) was superb for Stuart Lancaster's side throughout the RBS 6 Nations . \u2018I believe that he will be picked and that England will use him as a weapon off the bench with 10 or 15 minutes to go,\u2019 he said. \u2018He is a class footballer \u2013 a quality player and athlete. He\u2019s aggressive too, which he showed with the way he played in the rugby league Grand Final here last year. \u2018You would have him involved just for his mental approach and the way he takes the game on. There are going to be some tough calls, but just the fact that he is in the reckoning at all \u2013 even though he\u2019s only been in union a few months and had never played it before \u2013 is positive for him.\u2019 In contrast to his Kiwi counterpart, Steve Hansen, who is concerned that rugby is becoming boring, Cheika is expecting an \u2018awesome\u2019 World Cup with an emphasis on try-scoring, thanks in part to the improved pitches at leading grounds here such as Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium. \u2018It is like playing on a carpet,\u2019 he said. \u2018It makes teams a lot more confident to play positive footy.\u2019 Australia should be able to play positively, with their backline enhanced by the presence of Giteau \u2013 who had been in Test exile since moving to Toulon in 2011. Cheika confirmed yesterday that he met the 32-year-old recently, prior to the announcement of the ARU\u2019s historic policy change and believes that he can add utility value to the Wallaby squad. \u2018As far as I know, Matt Giteau has played No 9 there, on the odd occasion,\u2019 he said. \u2018His strength is at No 10 and No 12 obviously.\u2019 There will be reinforcements up front too, with veteran flanker George Smith another exile now back on the radar. He could find himself competing against a fit and revitalised David Pocock, and Michael Hooper \u2013 vying with hooker Stephen Moore for the captaincy \u2013 for the openside berth. With such pedigree in just one position, Australia\u2019s pack cannot be written off lightly. Cheika will use the jibes from afar to make sure his side are ready for the \u2018Pool of Death\u2019. England full back Mike Brown rises high to claim a high ball despite the attention of Noa Nakaitaci . Cheika is convinced Burgess will feature for England at the World Cup despite his quiet start in union .

The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to

More than 40 years after The Exorcist left cinema audiences green, the Vatican has gathered a team of experts including practising exorcists to give ordinary Catholics the tools needed to recognise a case of demonic possession when they see one \u2013 and teach them what to do about it. The tenth edition of the annual course, \u2018Exorcism and Prayer of Liberation,\u2019 sponsored by the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy, the department responsible for overseeing matters regarding priests, began this morning at Rome\u2019s Regina Apostolorum University. More than 40 years after The Exorcist (pictured) left cinema audiences green,\u00a0The Vatican are training up ordinary doctors, teachers and psychologists to cope with a rising tide of demonic possessions . One of the main purposes of the course is help would-be exorcists distinguish demonic possession from psychological or medical conditions, organisers said. In 2013 Francis appeared to perform an exorcism on a young man in a wheelchair who shook violently when the pope laid his hands on him and said a blessing. He has frequently expressed the belief that the devil really exists and is not merely \u2018a myth, a figure, an idea, the idea of evil.\u2019 Experts say demonic activity is on the rise due to an in creased interest in the occult among the young including ouija boards and seances. Last year the International Association of Exorcists claimed it was \u2018a pastoral emergency.\u201d In 2013, Pope Francis (pictured( appeared to perform an exorcism on a young man in a wheelchair .

The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\". It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President. 'We thought it was going to happen this year.

Kim and Khloe Kardashian laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame during their April 10 visit. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend, Kim Kardashian wrote in an op-ed, 'I would like President Obama to use the word \u201cgenocide.\u201d It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President' Tricky language: President Barack Obama sent an administration official to Armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim and Khloe walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial. They were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Khloe's  Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use last week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff also said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kardashian, who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins\u00a0Kara and Kourtni\u00a0Kardashian, said, 'Now is the time to speak out, and every little bit helps' 'I will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was,' the reality television star said, encouraging Turkey to label the killings as a genocide. 'It\u2019s not the fault of the people who live there now, ' she noted, and 'I think if they recognize it and acknowledge it, everyone can move on. 'I believe in moving on and looking toward a brighter future, but you can\u2019t move on unless you acknowledge the past. To not do so is an act of disrespect.' Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . Kardashian recalled in the op-ed that her family tree would have ended if her grandparents hadn't left Armenia for Los Angeles the year before the armed conflict. 'There are so many people who lost their families, and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking\u2014they should never be forgotten,' she wrote. 'The whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. A million-and-a-half people were brutally massacred, and a country can just pretend like it never happened? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.' While in Armenia, Kardashian and her family visited the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame that honors those countryman who were killed in 1915. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the flame. Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a\u00a0blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it. 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip to her ancestors' homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Khloe also kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Friday  the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters, beating its goal of 200,000 names. Google did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle, however. The White House said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' It announced at the same time that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew would attend a ceremony in Armenia on Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name this year to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed.", "claim": "kim and khloe kardashian laid flowers at the armenian genocide memorial. the reality star said it was' very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office. kardashian, whose armenian heritage comes from her father, has used her celebrity since 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide.", "cnndm_id": "12670e6af0ccf95cf8de50f651f0fded33d419b0", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians.", "The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office.", "Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide.", "Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\".", "It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President.", "'We thought it was going to happen this year.", "I feel like we\u2019re close \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.

One is pretty devastating on native fish, it's an anchor worm which is a little crustacean that leaves a hideous, hideous impact on native fish and was probably introduced by goldfish.

'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life.

'I started collecting when I was getting bullied at school, Pokemon was the only thing that made me feel happy.' Sharon Courtney said she did not mind moving to a smaller bedroom as Pokemon was so important to her daughter. 'I love Pokemon now. It helped Lisa through horrific times when she was at school and was kicked in the head and the back. 'Every time she came home and was tearful she would go to Pokemon and she would be smiling. 'She would love to work in Japan at the Pokemon Centre - more than winning the lottery - that would be her dream!' Lisa appears on Collectaholics on BBC2 at 7pm last night . Lisa spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales  hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive,' she added. Despite trying to save money where she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. I bought mine for \u00a360 online.

Yes, while most of the tickets for the highly-anticipated clash have sold out, there are still some floating around on secondary sites with ringside seats going at crazy money.

As of lunchtime Friday, the most expensive seat on sale through the StubHub website, was retailing for a mammoth $128,705 but has since skyrocketed. Tickets were released last Thursday, just eight days before one of the biggest fights in history after legal wrangling between the two camps.

Not long after some were made available on resale websites at a mark up that could only be dreamed about even by the sharpest financial trader. Those at the lower end of the eye-watering scale -- priced between $1,500 and $7,500 -- were snapped up in a matter of minutes.

Harry Kane has been nominated for PFA Player of the Year after a standout season for Tottneham . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino says Kane deserves to win the award for his impact on English football . But Pochettino says Kane, who could become the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Gary Lineker achieved the feat 27 years ago, should take the award. 'I think that Hazard is a very good player, he's fantastic, a great player. But the impact that Harry has had on English football is massive.

It's not a pre-season tour where you spend maybe 14-15 days away. 'On a pre-season, you need good pitches for training. You have a problem with traffic like happened on the last pre-season tour.

Leading the pack was a familiar face, that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Today, he was more concerned about the Queen and her 89th birthday and happily showed off a handmade sign wishing her many happy returns.

Also watching proceedings was royal fan Terry Hut, 79, who, in his Union flag suit, umbrella hat and sunglasses, provided the grey London street with a bright splash of colour. Mr Hut, who came prepared with Prince and Princess balloons, is a veteran of several royal births and spent 12 days camping outside the Lindo Wing ahead of Prince George's birth.

Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a \u00a31,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Memorabilia: Mrs Tyler, who has a royal collection worth \u00a310,000, came prepared with a Kate figurine . Cheerful: Despite their long wait, the group all appeared to be in good spirits . Ready for action: Mr Hut and Mr Loughrey both came prepared with balloons and signs . Serious business: While the royal fans sang, the police conducted a search of the area . Like Mr Loughery and Mr Hut, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "New York City cab drivers spend their entire work days eavesdropping on their customers conversations, so it's no surprise that many of them have learned a thing or two about love and relationships along the way. With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'.

Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland \u2013 specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland\u2019s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the\u00a0Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe\u2019s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya\u2019s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros.

It marks the end of a six-year case, after the teenagers first reported their ordeal to officials at Clatskanie Middle School in Oregon - only to be told to 'suck it up'. Josi Harrison, Laura Lefebvre, and Hailey Walden were all in eighth grade when they claim their high school-age boyfriends lured them into sending nude pictures to their phones. Ordeal: Laura Lefebvre (left) and Josi Harrison (right) are two of three girls who have won a civil claim against their school district for failing to support them after being bullied into sending naked pictures to boyfriends . Traumatic: Hailey Walden, now a straight-A student, left Clatskanie Middle School to escape the harrowing experience after the principal and local police chief said she would be charged for the distribution of photos . After sending one, they were blackmailed into sending more. However, when they sought help from the principal and Clatskanie District police chief, they were told they would be charged with creating and distributing child pornography. On Thursday, two years after filing a civil suit against Clatskanie School District, a judge has ordered that each girl receive $75,000 in damages. All three girls have subsequently moved to new schools. Speaking in December 2013, Hailey Walden told\u00a0KATU: 'We had grown up with each other and he was always the popular cool guy that everyone wanted to date. I was 13, I didn't know. I thought that if I sent him the picture he would think I'm pretty and love me.' In total, she sent him 30 pictures, which then swept the school. However, her mother Billi Leinonen told the station, principal Jeff Baughman and police chief Marvin Hoover 'chuckled' when they brought the case to them. Hoover, she says, started reading Hailey her Miranda rights and said she would be charged. Though no charges were filed against Hailey, she claims the meeting exacerbated her trauma. On Thursday Clatskanie School District, which encapsulates CMHS, was ordered to pay $225,000 to the girls . Josi Harrison and Laura Lefebvre reported similar conflicts with school officials. Along with Hailey, they filed a $2.5 million federal suit against the district in 2013. The judge ordered a reduced payment on the grounds that the school has taken commendable steps to ensure the situation is not repeated. An attorney for one of the girls, Amber Lunsford, told Oregon Live: 'This suit was never about the money. It was about effecting change.' She added: 'Each of the girls accomplished what they wanted.' Reacting to the settlement on Thursday, Josi told\u00a0Fox 12 Oregon: 'I feel like it made me have to fight battles I shouldn\u2019t have to fight, especially at such a young age, but I feel it made me stronger.'

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "We are well versed in the dangers of using sunbeds, with skin cancer preying on the minds of all who expose their skin to the UV rays. But experts have warned the disease is not the only health danger associated with the pursuit of an artificial year-round tan. Those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes. Dermatologist\u00a0Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes . Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up. Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns the virus, and other bacteria, can survive on tanning beds, despite the heat. 'In my practice, I've seen acquired bacterial infections, warts, and herpes infections from tanning beds,' she told Yahoo. She said staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause skin infections, faecal bacteria, the herpes virus and the wart-causing human papillomavirus are all able to withstand the heat of a sunbed to survive. Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down. The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive. When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses. It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware. 'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned. 'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.' Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system. Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users . Symptoms of genital herpes include: . These symptoms may last up to 20 days, but the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring. Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up, the virus remains dormant. It can be reactivated, causing recurrences, which are usually shorter and less severe.", "claim": "dermatologist dawn marie davies warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes. those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes.", "cnndm_id": "39553f1871b87d88d22bd3a1dd938b0142ced6ca", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["We are well versed in the dangers of using sunbeds, with skin cancer preying on the minds of all who expose their skin to the UV rays.", "But experts have warned the disease is not the only health danger associated with the pursuit of an artificial year-round tan.", "Those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes.", "Dermatologist\u00a0Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes .", "Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact.", "It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex.", "Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes.", "There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up.", "Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns the virus, and other bacteria, can survive on tanning beds, despite the heat.", "'In my practice, I've seen acquired bacterial infections, warts, and herpes infections from tanning beds,' she told Yahoo.", "She said staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause skin infections, faecal bacteria, the herpes virus and the wart-causing human papillomavirus are all able to withstand the heat of a sunbed to survive.", "Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down.", "The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive.", "When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses.", "It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware.", "'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned.", "'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.'", "Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact.", "It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex.", "Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes.", "A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system.", "Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact.", "Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users .", "Symptoms of genital herpes include: .", "These symptoms may last up to 20 days, but the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring.", "Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up, the virus remains dormant.", "It can be reactivated, causing recurrences, which are usually shorter and less severe."], "sum_sents": ["dermatologist dawn marie davies warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes.", "those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes."], "rel_index": [2, 3, 15]}

And with a world gold medal still proving elusive, the 32-year-old Adams insists she has absolutely no plan to set a time-scale on when it will finally be time to hang up her golden gloves. British boxer Nicola Adams is hoping to become a double Olympic gold medallist in Rio . Adams (right, pictured during her London 2012 final win over Cancan Ren) is hoping to retain her crown . Adams said: 'I will keep fighting as long as I have the motivation to do so and there is no reason why that should not continue after the Rio Olympics.

During the drunken attack, which was caught on CCTV, Scots Guard Shaun Smith, 25, can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim\u2019s head. His fellow soldier, Welsh Guard Jason Collins, 22, rained blows with his fists on to the man\u2019s body. Scroll down for video . CCTV cameras captured the horrifying attack last April in which soldiers Shaun Smith (left, in black jeans) and Jason Collins (right, bending over), kicked and punched two men repeatedly near their barracks . Collins, 22, (right) has been stationed at Buckingham Palace since the attack. Smith (left), was described as an 'angel' in court by his officer . The soldiers were expected to be jailed for the \u2018deeply unpleasant and inexcusable\u2019 assault. But yesterday a judge at Teesside Crown Court made what even he admitted was an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 decision to let the men walk free. Judge James Hill, QC, said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them. \u2018I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope, as your commanding officers have expressed, that the Army feels able to keep you.\u2019 The furious victim James Wormald \u2013 who was left with the imprint of Smith\u2019s shoe on his forehead \u2013 said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened. \u2018There was absolutely no reason for the attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong. With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck, Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them. A judge rejected their version of events, saying the man seen in the footage (above) posed 'no threat' when they were beating him . \u2018I don\u2019t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries, the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it.\u2019 Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm. Smith was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work. Collins was given a 12-month community order, and both men were each told to pay \u00a31,000 compensation. The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service's sentencing guidelines. With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each, the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years. Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as 'exceptional'. In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised. Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended, while Collins received a 12-month community order. The pair launched the vicious attack after a night\u2019s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April. They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots. They encountered local men Mr Wormald, 25, and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words. Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them \u2013 a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald, a chef. The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald. Their victim runs across a road, trips and falls. Smith, who has a hood covering his face, can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim\u2019s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald\u2019s body. The pair then ran off and hid in a stream, but were caught by the police. Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face. Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James\u2019s Palace since the incident. He is likely to keep his job. Scots Guard Smith was also of previous good character.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will \"fix\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful. RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves. A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real \"crossroads of America.\" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work.", "claim": "gov. mike pence said on tuesday that the state will fix the religious freedom restoration act, or rfra, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. pence is making the right call.", "cnndm_id": "3ad0320476e8dda3a00604efdcf766e91766c815", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately.", "After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others, a recent study claimed . The implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding, it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders. This is because the genes that make up the people who we are, and the environments in which we are raised cannot be considered independently of each other. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right)\u00a0raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . The research analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. It found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population. In seeking to explain this connection, the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors. This can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together. On the other hand, their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases, with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members. Genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation (46 per cent) than for adult rape (19 per cent). While the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending, it cannot of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved. Dr Mairi Levitt says that\u00a0genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . Putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents. Of course genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment. As can be seen from the percentages above, the largest proportion of cases involved a large, rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour. You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in V\u00e4stmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of saliva from which the researchers extracted DNA. One of the genes examined was Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). This gene is a key enzyme which breaks down and releases energy in brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. The transmitter be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness . 'About 25 per cent of Caucasian men carry the less active variant of MAOA,' explained Professor Sheilagh Hodgins, a researcher at the University of Montreal. 'Among them, those who experience physical abuse in childhood are more likely than those who are not abused to display serious anti-social behaviour from childhood through adulthood.' Separating  nature and nurture may be useful as a model but does not really make sense because research has demonstrated that gene development is affected by the environment. Any report of genes influencing behaviour tends to polarise opinion. Some may welcome the science and see this as confirmation that sex offenders are biologically different from other people and could perhaps be prevented from offending. Others will be concerned about the stigmatisation of family members defined as 'at risk', but still unlikely to offend themselves. Only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at-risk families would mainly target the innocent. So what then might this mean in practical terms? The discovery could perhaps one day lead to the identification of specific genotypes but could or should this affect the way we deal with sex offenders? A genotype has already been identified that increases the risk of violent behaviour in specific environments. Dubbed the 'criminal' or 'warrior' gene, it has in some cases even been used successfully by defence teams in mitigation pleas to avoid the death penalty in the US, or reduce the length of sentences in the US and Italy. It might be thought odd that a convicted murderer, who is at increased risk of offending and therefore presumably more dangerous to the public in the future, would be treated more leniently. Sex offenders, particularly where children are involved, are probably even more stigmatised than other violent criminals so perhaps a genetic defence would not work in their favour. What is clear is that finding genetic influences on behaviour does not affect legal responsibility. It is recognised that there are many genetic, biological and environmental factors that influence behaviour, and it may be harder for all sorts of reasons for some people to refrain from criminal acts than others. Any research that helps us to understand problem behaviours is to be welcomed, but the headline figure \u2013 a genetic link in 40 per cent of cases \u2013 does not tell us that sex offenders 'can't help it' or are different from 'normal' people.

The visit, which kicked off with a pageant aboard a flotilla of boats on the local canal, was part of Willem-Alexander's 48th birthday celebrations. Koningsdag - or King's Day - is a public holiday in the Netherlands and is traditionally marked with a royal procession either in the capital Amsterdam or in one of the country's major cities. Happy family: The Dutch royals celebrated King Willem-Alexander's birthday in Dordrecht . Warm welcome: The Dutch royal couple were all smiles as they meet well-wishers in the trading city . Today, it was the turn of Dordrecht, a city in the south-west of the country, which was once a major trading port, as well as a military hub. Signs of its martial past were thin on the ground today, however, with the streets filled with a sea of joyful humanity, most of whom cheered and waved as the royals floated past. Taking centre stage was Argentina-born Queen Maxima, who opted for a typically eye-catching ensemble of a raspberry pink coat and hat enlivened with a pair of chunky crystal earrings. Also aboard the royal barge, the Dordtevaar, were the couple's three daughters:\u00a0Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange, 11, Princess Alexia, nine, and Princess Ariane, eight. Willem-Alexander's brother Prince Constantijn, 45, was also aboard, as was his 48-year-old wife, Princess Laurentien, who opted for a tailored dress in patriotic bright orange. Is that it? Eldest daughter Princess Catharina-Amalia, 11, cuddles up to her mother during the event . Round of applause: The Queen and the princesses join in with a round of applause for Willem-Alexander . Big arrival: The couple and their three daughters travelled through the city by barge . Family affair: \u00a0The couple was joined by Prince\u00a0Constantijn and his wife Laurentien who wore bright orange . Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in her summery raspberry pink get-up . Matching: The Dutch queen completed her look with a slick of bright pink lipstick and chunky earrings . All smiles: The 43-year-old appeared to be enjoying the occasion and smiled brightly throughout . Echoing their parents and uncle, all three girls smiled and waved at the crowds, most of whom seemed to be enjoying the bright spring sunshine while watching the procession go past. Others used the royal day off to make some extra money, with one enterprising soul setting up a stand that offered selfies with cardboard versions of the Dutch royals for \u20ac1 apiece. Koningsdag is a long-standing Dutch tradition that began in 1890 with Queen Wilhelmina who celebrated her birthday on the 31st August. When her daughter Juliana became Queen, the date was moved to the 30th April - a tradition maintained by her daughter Beatrix, even though her real birthday is the 31st January. Since April 2013, when Willem-Alexander took the throne following his mother's abdication, the holiday has taken place his birthday, the 27th April. The celebrations, which kick off the night before with King's Parties, also include vrijmarkts - flea markets - in most towns and mass consumption of a delicious orange pastry called the tompouce. A right royal selfie! A well-wisher snaps a selfie with the Dutch King and Queen . Royal wave: King Willem-Alexander waves at the crowds during a walk through the city with his children .

Winning the sweepstake was nice but three points was the main thing.\u2019 Leicester have appeared doomed to relegation for months, cemented to the bottom of the table since November.

But two successive wins give genuine hope of survival with seven games to play, five at home. Vardy struck a confident tone. Survival is, after all, in Leicester\u2019s hands. \u2018We\u2019ve all been running ourselves in the ground and not getting the points we deserve,\u2019 said Vardy. \u2018We\u2019ve not played bad in any game really.

Robert Huth found a leveller with 10 minutes to go before Vardy ran from halfway to drill a cracking finish in the first minute of injury time.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Caledonia, Michigan (CNN)Ben and Shelby Offrink met in college. It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. \"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,\" said Ben with a smile. \"He was sneaky,\" says Shelby. \"Yeah, I wanted to meet her,\" says Ben, \"and that was the best way I could figure out.\" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says. She breaks into tears: \"Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't.\"", "claim": "ben and shelby offrink met in

Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.'

There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065.

Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video . Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday . But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday . Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday . Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day . The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998.

The Denmark international was due to start the match but ended up being dropped from the entire squad after his poor timekeeping landed him in hot water with manager\u00a0Dieter Hecking. The Wolfsburg boss probably didn't need an invitation to lose his temper after watching his side crumble to a 4-1 home defeat by Napoli in the Europa League on Thursday and was obviously angered when Bendtner rolled up late the next day. Nicklas Bendtner was dropped from the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday's game after arriving late for training . Manager Dieter Hecking said that Bendtner would have started the match if he hadn't turned up late . 'Nicklas was going to play from the beginning but our training session was clearly earlier than he thought,' said boss Hecking. Sporting director Klaus Allofs added: 'There are a lot of ways of finding out when training is. And it is not as if there is that much traffic in Wolfsburg.' Hecking, speaking to Danish newspaper BT, said: 'As a team we have some rules that everyone should keep. When you break those rules you have to take the consequences.

Amedy Coulibaly stormed into the Hyper Cacher Jewish store, killing four and taking others captive before being shot dead in a hail of gunfire by French special forces. The heavily televised events in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Patrick Klugman, a lawyer representing the six survivors, said images broadcast from Hyper Cacher on January 9 'lacked the most basic precautions' and endangered those still alive inside. Scroll down for video . Police storm the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket, killing an Islamist terrorist in hail of gunfire. Six hostages who hid in a  freezer during the Islamist attacks have sued French media for broadcasting their location live . Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly slaughtered customers during the siege at the Hyper Cacher store. Lawyers claim French media endangered the lives of hostages hiding a freezer by revealing their location live on air . He singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV which revealed live on air that the group - including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby - was hiding  in the freezer. They had been taken to the cold room by one of the supermarket's employees. 'The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime,' Mr Klugman told AFP Thursday, roundly criticising coverage by other outlets of the movements by security forces during the standoff. The lives of those hiding 'could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting,' Klugman said. He added that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists. The lawsuit charges media  with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a \u20ac15,000 (\u00a311,000) fine.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans. Their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs. Over half, 54 per cent, also confessed they did not know that Lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites, affects their pets as well as themselves. Knowledge about Lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives. In extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases - such as Lyme disease - to humans . At the other extreme, symptoms may be so mild that someone who's been bitten by an infected tick may experience only flu-like symptoms. Ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans. Areas of undergrowth (including parks and gardens - as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife. It's why most people are bitten below the waist. With the forecast of increasingly damp winters and hotter summers - ideal conditions for the ticks to thrive - as well as growth in deer numbers, the concern is that the incidence of Lyme disease will rise further. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of Europe and North America. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease which can infect humans . Many people with early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around 3 to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans. Some people with Lyme disease also experience flu-like symptoms in the early stages, such as tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, joint pain,headaches, a high temperature (fever), chills and neck stiffness. More serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on. These can include: . Some of these problems will get better slowly with treatment, although they can persist if treatment is started late. A few people with Lyme disease go on to develop long-term symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. This is known as post-infectious Lyme disease. Source: NHS Choices . The increase in incidence of illnesses such as Lyme is 'a serious' cause for concern and 'ticks will become a very serious public health issue in the UK as a result of climate change', claims Julie Barratt, the director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health. She thinks we need to take a similar approach to avoiding tick-borne disease as we do to sun exposure - covering up and using insect repellent as we would sunscreen. This means taking precautions 'in the great outdoors, whether you're camping, walking in the countryside or in your back garden', she says. Concerned vets across the UK are now urging people to get their dogs checked out for the pests. Any ticks collected by vet practices will be sent to a team of scientists who will examine them for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Professor Richard Wall, from the University of Bristol, will be part of a team studying the ticks, and says their numbers have soared in the last 10 years. He said: 'Current evidence suggests that many tick-borne diseases in northern Europe are increasing in prevalence as a result of factors.' He explained this is due to changes in their habitat, increasing pet travel and climate change. He added: 'Warmer and wetter winters and milder wetter summers, in particular, may allow the normal highly seasonal pattern of tick activity to be extended, giving more continuous periods of exposure. 'In Great Britain the distribution of ticks is estimated to have expanded in the last 10 years by 17 per cent and the abundance of ticks to have increased at 73 per cent of locations surveyed.' Many people do not realise it is possible to catch Lyme disease in Britain. Joanne Drayson, from Guildford, who contracted the illness after being bitten by an infected tick while walking her dog, did not know it was possible to catch it in the UK. She said: 'I was aware of the disease but always thought it was something that was unique to the United States. 'After a long course of antibiotics, I gradually recovered my health. I still enjoy walking in the woods but now I go more prepared. 'It is important to cover up, tuck your trousers in your socks, have long sleeves and when you leave the woodland or countryside to always check for any ticks.' Public Health England estimates the number of new Lyme disease cases each year at around 3,000, while charities say the figure is closer to 15,000. In spite of this, the majority of people are still unaware that the potentially debilitating condition also affects dogs. Lyme disease is caused by a bite from an infected tick. Dogs can become bitten during walks in wooded areas or parkland in both urban and rural areas. Symptoms in dogs include lameness, lethargy and fever, which, if left untreated, can lead to more serious conditions such as kidney disease and heart failure. Many cases of Lyme disease are likely to go unnoticed by owners as they are only detected by a thorough examination. Throughout spring and early summer when ticks are most actives, vets taking part in The Big Tick Project, will be giving dogs visiting their practice a tick check. Ticks collected will be sent off for scientific analysis where they will be examined for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The Big Tick Project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham who wants to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with Lyme disease . The project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham and aims to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with the tick-borne disease. He said: 'Research suggests that ticks are a growing problem whether that's urban parkland to woodland and open country. 'Living as I do in the New Forest where ticks can be a problem and present a real threat to my dogs, this project is close to my heart and could be important in advancing both for canine and human health. 'I know people who have contracted the disease and I cannot begin to imagine how I would feel if my dogs were to catch it too. 'While I find ticks interesting creatures, I don't want them on my dogs, in my house or on me. 'If like me, you love your dogs, you'll want the best advice and treatment to help reduce the risks associated with ticks and tick-borne disease. 'I know I can get this by talking to a vet with access to the latest innovative and effective products available to help tackle this issue.'", "claim": "vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks. in extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected. vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks.", "cnndm_id": "63265840c7cbe533e11cce335ef03727af611af3", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans.", "Their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs.", "Over half, 54 per cent, also confessed they did not know that Lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites, affects their pets as well as themselves.", "Knowledge about Lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives.", "In extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.", "Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases -

The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening \u00a3800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . \u2022 Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . \u2022 The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . \u2022 Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . \u2022 The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . \u2022 Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . \u2022 The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres \u2013 on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for \u00a380m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

Karen Catherall, 45, was viciously beaten and strangled to death by Darren Jeffreys, who she met only weeks earlier on dating site Plenty of Fish. The pair had been drinking at the pub before she returned to her home in Gwernaffield near Mold, Flintshire, North Wales, when Jeffreys, 47, followed and attacked in an alcohol-fuelled rage. Scroll down for video . Karen Catherall, 45, (right) was brutally murdered by Darren Jefferys (left) who she met on a dating site just weeks before her death. He was jailed for a minimum of 17 and a half years in February . He only called paramedics the following morning and claimed he thought Ms Catherall was sleeping, but later admitted murder and was jailed for life in February. Police have since told the family that the mother-of-two made a 999 call from her mobile just after she returned from the pub, which went through to BT to deal with. Operators at the telecommunications company connects both mobile and landline numbers with the requested emergency service and follow strict protocol. But when Ms Catherall called on September 13, last year, the call handler said they could not hear anything and therefore did not connect the call to the police or send help. Her mother, Glenys Keir, 74, and sister Lorraine Humphreys, 49, have slammed BT for not taking action at the time which they claim could have saved their sister. However, BT says its handlers acted appropriately and in line with police guidance not to pass on calls where there is 'nothing to indicate there is any problem'. Mrs Keir said: 'When we found out Karen had been murdered our whole world fell apart. 'But as we were starting to come to terms with it all, to then hear that a 999 call had been made from her mobile the night she died, it stirred up all of those emotions we had felt when we first found out Karen had been killed.

'It left us feeling sick to the stomach, devastated and fuming, knowing no one was there for Karen when she needed help. 'If they had got to her in time Karen might still be alive.

Police confirmed a 999 call was made from her mobile phone to BT  at around 7pm but it was disconnected after around 13 seconds and officers were not informed. Glenys Kier and her partner Esmor Evans leaving Mold Crown Court following the trial of their daughter's killer, Darren Jeffreys . The phone call was later enhanced by detectives, who discovered arguing could be heard in the background. Ms Catherall's family are calling on BT to review their procedures, and answer questions about the call. Mrs Keir said: 'Apparently the person who picked up believed there was silence at the end of the line. They must have assumed 999 had been dialled accidentally. 'It doesn't bear thinking about what might have happened if BT had connected the call to the police.' Ms Catherall's sister, Mrs Humphreys, a catering supervisor, added: 'You regularly hear of toddlers playing with their mum's mobile phone and ringing the emergency services by mistake. 'In those instances, the police often seem to trace the call and turn up on the doorstep. 'We want to know why that didn't happen when in this situation Karen so desperately needed their help. 'We know the police aren't to blame as they never received the call, but BT should be looking into this and reviewing their policies. 'The call might have been muffled or quiet at the other end of the line, but surely it's better to put it through to the police so they can send an officer and be safe rather than sorry. 'Who knows what the outcome might have been if they had reached her in time? We don't want any other families to lose a loved one and go through the pain we have.' A BT spokesman said: 'North Wales Police contacted BT on September 24, 2014 about whether we received an emergency call from a mobile phone number and we provided them with full details including a call recording. 'Our records show that we received the call at approximately 19.07 on September 13, 2014. 'There was no response to our operator's questioning and our operator heard nothing to indicate there was any problem before the caller ended the call after about 13 seconds. 'Police forces have requested that we do not connect such calls to them and our operator correctly followed the call handling process requested by the police.' Ms Catherall's family (pictured outside court) are calling on BT to review their procedures following the call . The 999 emergency number was set up in London in June 1937 after five women were killed in a fire. A committee discussed how telephone operators could identify emergency calls and the easy to remember 999 number was born. It was later rolled out in Glasgow and extended to all major towns and cities by 1948. Since then it has expanded massively with an average of 597,000 calls a week across the UK. BT operators answer the initial call from both landlines and mobiles and find out which emergency service is required before connecting the caller. The handler has to quickly establish whether the call is genuine before transferring them. In instances where they are met with silence they ask the caller to respond by either making a noise or coughing. This can narrow down the number of accidental or prank calls made, which account for about half of the 31 million calls made annually. Of the remaining 15.5million, 52 per cent go to police, 41 per cent to ambulance service, six per cent for fire and one per cent to the coastguard and cave and mountain rescue services. The spokesman also explained that in cases where they get no response from the caller, the operator will ask whether they can make a noise or cough. In this instance Ms Catherall apparently made no response and the phone call was terminated. Detective Inspector Mark Hughes, senior investigating officer at North Wales Police, confirmed the call. He said: 'During the early evening of September 13, 2014, a 999 call was made from the mobile phone of Karen Catherall. 'The phone call was received by the telephone company operator and managed in accordance with their policy but not directed onto North Wales Police, nor in fact any police force. 'I understand the circumstances surrounding the management of this phone call are now being reviewed by the Telephone Company following a request by Karen's family.'

Charlene Bishop, who is 17 months old, went to feed her pony Taffee on Wednesday and was worried when she didn't meet her at the gate as normal. Her mother Danielle Flisher went to investigate and found the Shetland lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries. Sickening: Taffee the Shetland pony was\u00a0battered to death with a breeze block in the middle of the night in a brutal attack .

Police believe Taffee was battered round the head with a breeze block sometime between 11pm on Tuesday night and 9am on Wednesday morning. Charlene, who had only owned 22in\u00a0Taffee for three months, visited her every day to groom and feed her and rode her every weekend. Ms Flisher, 19, said: 'I don't understand how anybody could be so sick. 'Taffee was a tiny pony. The vet said she was hit over and over again and it looks like by was more than one person.

Vile: The Shetland was found lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries after the brutal attack . 'We got Taffee for Charlene when she was diagnosed with epilepsy. She can't do the same things as everyone else, but she loved spending time with me at the yard and had Taffee to keep her happy. 'They weren't together long but they were amazing. Charlene would climb all over her and Taffee wouldn't mind. 'Charlene would even sometimes tell Taffee off and the pony would go and stand in the corner of the stable like a naughty child. 'She's lost her best friend and she's devastated.' Taffee had a foal, 10-month-old Biscuit, who the family are now in the process of finding a surrogate mother for.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "English cricket\u2019s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director. Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body\u2019s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England\u2019s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just \u2018too accident prone\u2019. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him \u2018the outstanding coach of his generation\u2019. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. \u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019 Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. \u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019 Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen\u2019s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to \u2018create a culture\u2019 in which captain Alastair Cook had \u2018the full support of all players\u2019.

The\u00a0Conservatives yesterday returned a donation of \u00a350,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But last night it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. The revelation by the Independent newspaper will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe. Last week his party's manifesto pledged to raise \u00a35 billion from clamping down on tax avoidance during the next Parliament. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans. Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.' Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than \u00a350,000 to the Conservatives. She and her husband were close friends of Margaret Thatcher and were guests of the Reagans at the White House. In his memoirs, her husband said he only pleaded guilty to get the US authorities to leave his family in peace. The revelation  will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe . He wrote: 'It was galling to listen to these vast sums of money being referred to as though they were merely numbers and to the fact that I had agreed to hand all this money to the US Government. 'But the future peace and security of the family which this agreement would secure meant that I could see advantage in what I was about to do. But that did not make it right.' A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Tollman told the Independent: 'In so far as Mrs Tollman is concerned you will see she is of good character and was acquitted of all charges.' Responding to Mr Tollman's guilty plea, a spokesman said: 'Stanley Tollman admitted to having failed to report on his US tax return two bank accounts situated outside the US. It was that omission for which he was sentenced to one day's unsupervised probation.

As Ecuador residents arrived, not in Costa Rica but another Ecuador airport, Tena, where they were given fake stamps in their passports as they went through a staged passport control. No attention to detail was spared as huge posters were placed over the welcome billboards at the airport. Adverts depicting Imperial beer and 'Esencial Costa Rica,' Costa Rica's national brand,  were displayed in the airport to throw the group off the scent. Even fictitious immigration documents and car licence plates were created to make the group think they were in Golfito, a port town in Costa Rica. On top of all that organisers used mobile phone and GPS blockers to keep passengers from using technology to discover the hoax. The Tame airline staged the prank in a bid to demonstrate that Ecuador should be considered a top tourist destination . A fake passport control was set up, which even gave out fake stamps for passports . The unsuspecting tourists took part in a number of exciting activities, from white water rafting to hiking . The prank was captured by video but following complaints, the tourism organisers in Ecuador took the video down.

He explains how he was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse on Wednesday, to make a left turn, when he decided to use the empty median lane to access the left turn lane, which was full. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're bad': Will Stack, 22, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, has released a video (pictured) disputing claims that all white officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color' Moments later, he was stopped by the cop for 'improper use of the median'. 'He told me what I did, asked for my license and registration, I gave that to him,' Mr Stack says in the selfie-style video. He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook\u00a0page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story.

'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?' Mr Stack captured the video just days after North Charleston officer Michael Slager was arrested for murder for allegedly shooting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "The casket of promising basketball player Lauren Hill has been moved into the 10,000-seater arena where she made her first basket in a college game just five months ago. The 19-year-old defied doctors' expectations after she was diagnosed with a rare form of inoperable brain cancer just after her 18th birthday. She was told she would not live past December but died four months later this month after playing with her college team at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati to raise $1.5million for research into childhood cancer. Scroll down for video . The casket of  basketball player Lauren Hill was placed at the site where she made her first basket five months ago, before she died of an inoperable brain tumour this month. Her high school team mates gathered to remember her at a memorial today in the arena where she scored her first basket for her college team . Today mourners at the arena celebrated her life and determination in the face of the obstacles she overcame in her short life. Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma after she became dizzy following a basketball game with\u00a0her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The tumour is found on the brain stem and can cause double vision and difficulty controlling facial expressions. Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December.\u00a0The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James\u00a0posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:\" What am I doing with my life?\" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. \"How can I be a better person?\" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial .

Mr and Mrs Hill (right) followed the casket at the conclusion of the hour-long memorial service in Cincinnati . The arena was packed for the game, which started with a set play to get her a left-handed layup. She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's\u00a066-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 \u2014 her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs \u2014 Katy Perry's 'Roar' \u2014 was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million \u2014 matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati .

Campaign: Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Elmo explain why getting vaccinated is crucial to keep other children safe and healthy . As Dr Murthy visits Sesame Street, Elmo tells him he is 'worried about getting a shot,' asking the Surgeon General: 'Why does everyone need a vaccination, anyway?' In response Dr Murthy compares getting vaccinated to using an umbrella when it rains and wearing a helmet on a bike. This calms Elmo who gets the shot he needs, and after realising how quick and painless it is to get a shot, he asks Dr Murthy whey everybody doesn't get a vaccination? 'That's a good question, Elmo,' Murthy says, looking at the camera. 'That's a good question.' The video, produced by the Daily Dot, is accompanied by a shorter 30-second video of Elmo and the Surgeon General released by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The campaign videos have been released in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December, sickened 147 people in the U.S., which has seen the debate over vaccination flare up. Officials at the California Department of Public Health said no new infections have been reported for the past 42 days \u2014 or two incubation periods \u2014 meaning the outbreak is over in the U.S. Many who fell ill in the Disneyland episode were not immunized against measles. Some cited personal reasons for refusing shots, and others were too young to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. In California, where 131 of the 147 measles cases could be found, a vaccination bill has generated intense debates pitting personal rights against public health.

The measure would bar parents from seeking vaccine exemptions for their children because of religious or personal beliefs, joining California with Mississippi and West Virginia in such strict requirements. Medical waivers would only be available for children with health problems, forcing unvaccinated children to be homeschooled. California lawmakers were set to vote on the bill last week, but this was postponed by supporters postponed so authors could work on revisions to address concerns raised in the Senate Education Committee.

Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming \u2014 the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers. But Comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions. 'Washington's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company,' wrote analyst Craig Moffett in a client email. 'For all intents and purposes, their M&A ambitions would be on ice in the U.S.' Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3052969/Reports-say-Comcast-plans-drop-45B-Time-Warner-Cable-bid.html#ixzz3YAkxSfYl Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook .", "claim": "experts, including columbia university professor tim wu, declared the comcast-time warner cable murder dead after the fcc expressed skepticism. the move comes after federal communications commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers. comcast and time warner cable declined to comment on thursday.", "cnndm_id": "8ba5777dc7f6b5939f709a77f91fef2cda9e07d4", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today.", "The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox.", "Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon\u00a0that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government.", "An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow.", "\u00a0Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday.", "Scroll down for video .", "Ding-dong:", "Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism .", "Mega", "-", "merger", ":", "The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million.", "The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers .", "The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation.", "On Wednesday night, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest.", "Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal -

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Not only does Gareth Bale definitely want to stay at Real Madrid beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world. Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United . Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters . Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final . He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday . The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes . The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey . The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season . He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas . De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea . De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318million . All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "Green party leader Natalie Bennett has been forced to distance herself from a bizarre online site run by her boyfriend. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember\u2026 Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.' Another post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil and held in a cellar for . Mr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.' Ms Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for \u00a3249,950 in 2007 in North London. Last night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks. A spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011.

So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area. The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families. And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California. The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m. Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes. One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families. The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments. Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there. However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation. 'He said \"we've got enough millionaires here. What we need is some houses for regular working people\",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS. Scrapped: This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled . Idyllic: The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families . Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, \"if I\u2019m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?\"' It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy. In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan. The case was a major blow to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia, after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with San Francisco.", "claim": "george lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on his grady ranch in marin county, california. the complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the star wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families.", "cnndm_id": "a4dfb18d881e6792f32e45af6d44722e4ddc00e9", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["His neighbors wouldn't let him build a film studio.", "So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area.", "The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families.", "And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it.", "SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .", "Making waves:", "George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched .", "Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012.", "Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'.", "But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California.", "The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m.", "Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes.", "One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families.", "The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments.", "Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there.", "However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation.", "'He said \"we've got enough millionaires here.", "What we need is some houses for regular working people\",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS.", "Scrapped:", "This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled .", "Idyllic:", "The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families .", "Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, \"if I\u2019m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?\"'", "It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy.", "In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan.", "The case was a major blow to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia, after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with San Francisco."], "sum_sents": ["george lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on his grady ranch in marin county, california.", "the complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the star wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families."], "rel_index": [2, 6, 9]}
{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "The little girl who broke millions of hearts after surrendering to a camera she mistook for a gun is now in the clutches of Al Qaeda, the MailOnline can exclusively reveal. Four-year-old Hudea was pictured late last year by photographer Osman Sagirli in Atmeh refugee camp, just 10km from the border with Turkey. She, her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the Syrian camp since Hudea's father was killed in the 2012 Hama massacre. But two weeks ago, the family took a fateful decision to move south, towards the city of Idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of Al Qaeda's brutal Syrian affiliate at the weekend. It means, once more, the family are in danger of becoming victims of a battle between the regime and rebels which has killed 220,000 since 2011 - 10,000 of whom were children. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Taken at the Atmeh refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey, the image shows four-year-old Hudea frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed . Hudea and her family left the camp two weeks ago; it is thought they headed for Idlib - now in the control of Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra. Pictured: An Al-Nusra fighter holds his group flag  in front of Idlib's governor building . Sharia law: Al-Nusra have promised to bring in Sharia law in the city, and have already started burning things considered banned under Islam - like these cigarettes . The Nusra Front-led rebels is set impose Sharia law on the city, which is only the second state capital to fall from the grip of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. 'We salute the people of Idlib and their stand with their sons, the Mujahideen, ... and God willing they will enjoy the justice of sharia, which will preserve their religion and their blood,' said Abu Mohamad al-Golani, Nusra Front's leader, in a recording released on Wednesday. This is horrifying news for those living under the Nusra Front. The group\u00a0group has a reputation for violence which is only rivaled by the horrors seen in ISIS-controlled territory. Charlie Winter, of the Qilliam Foundation, warned: 'Jabhat al-Nusra is an outspoken al-Qaeda affiliate. It espouses a severe interpretation of Islam and sharia law. 'They have been known to execute women who are allegedly running brothels, and stone adulterers. It is a violent interpretation of sharia law.' Indeed, the group appears to be all but following in the footsteps of ISIS, who have terrified the world with an onslaught of violence, including throwing people from the tops of buildings and getting small children to shoot so-called spies dead. Worringly, the Nusra Front - who reiterated their allegiance to Al Qaeda in the last month - have said they want to create their own 'Islamic state'. The group is known for its use of suicide bombers as it tries to achieve its goal, and has claimed\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0mass executions, murdered journalists and even priests in the past few years. In the days since they took control of Idlib, there have been reports of two Christian men being executed, while the Vatican - citing local news sources - claimed a Greek Orthodox priest had been kidnapped by jihadists. Fight: The city fell after a four day battle which saw fighters on both sides lose their lives . Flee: It is thought about 15,000 people ran from the city as the Nusra Front approached . Trauma: Save the Children reports many of the children were traumatised by what they had seen . For a child like Hudea, who has clearly already been left horribly traumatised by a war which has been raging her entire life, life under the strict sharia law is likely to be nothing be more terrifying. But life is no better under the Syrian regime: indeed, it is al-Assad's fighters who were said to be behind the Hama massacre in which she lost her father. Pro-government militia killed at least 55 people that day, going from house to house, murdering men, women and children. It was after this the family fled north, to the camp near the border with Turkey, which has grown to become a home to 30,000 refugees. But despite being so close to the safety of Turkey, the family appear to have never made it across. Instead, for reasons unknown to MailOnline's source within the camp, they decided to leave the camp - venturing out into territory which has changed hands between the different rebel factions and the al-Assad regime numerous times over the last four years. The MailOnline's source within the camp said: 'The child does not exist now in the camp. They fled to a village in Idlib about two weeks ago.' Wherever they have gone, it means the family are trapped once more between three violent sides - none of which are prepared to stop until they have wiped the other off the face of the earth. Relative safety: Many of the 15,000 are headed to refugee camps like Atmeh, near the Turkish border - but it is not known where Hudea and her small family are . Civil war: Fighting has been going on Hudea's entire life, killing 10,000 children since 2011. Pictured: Atmeh, her home after he father was killed in 2012 . And living in an area recently won by one side, does not guarantee survival - or peace. A source in the Syrian military force told EA World View: 'We have an obligation to liberate the city... I swear to god the highest we are not scared.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at University of Oklahoma, was also certain Damascus would not give up without a fight. He told\u00a0Bloomberg:\u00a0'Assad will likely bomb Idlib so that its captors find little peace in their new prize.' Mr Winter thinks it is unlikely they will have gone to areas controlled by the Syrian government. One suspects the memory of what they did to her husband will mean Hudea's mother will keep her family away from al-Assad's forces. But villages not in the control of the regime have come under attack since Nusra Front's assault on Idlib - which itself sent 15,000 people fleeing for their lives. Ironically, many are making their way to the refugee camps in the north - like Atmeh, the safe haven Hudea has just left. And now there are reports of the regime using chlorine-filled bombs against the towns\u00a0surrounding\u00a0Idlib - a new horror for the little girl and her family to contend with.

Additionally, the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale, which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg. The roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake. And when paired with one of Dunkin Donuts' new ice cream-inspired coffee flavors - Rocky Road Swirl, Butter Pecan Swirl, or Cookie Dough Swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal, if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee. Another option listed on the new menu is the Southwest Supreme Bagel, which is stuffed with cheese, corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes, onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake.

Indeed, the only 'healthy' option offered on the new menu is a small Snack N\u2019 Go Steak Wrap, a 210-calorie snack that contains 'our delicious angus steak, a slice of cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce, wrapped in a warm tortilla'. But while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier, low-calorie option, it still contains five grams of saturated fats, which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake. Last, but not least, the menu also contains two new varieties of Dunkin Donuts' signature Cheesecake Square Donut, which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling, this time in Oreo and raspberry flavors. And while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the Dunkin website, the standard Cheesecake Square Donut contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance. Unsurprisingly, the chain's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health-conscious Twitter users to voice their concerns over the calorie-laden choices.

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.' It is not known whether Gywneth's two children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, ten, and Moses, nine, will also be taking part in the challenge however, given the limited supply of food featured in her Twitter picture, it is thought the Shakespeare in Love star is going it alone this time around.", "claim": "gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. the silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend.", "cnndm_id": "b40397497a58ac9ce935ffa7df6c331c7520a1af", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Gwyneth Paltrow has vowed to live on just $29 worth of food for a week, after agreeing to take on a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness and funds for New York's food banks.", "The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans.", "'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image.", "Food-focused:", "Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks .", "Alexander Wang Satin Blazer .", "Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter .", "Visit site .", "A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe.", "But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye.", "The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath.", "The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend.", "Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores.", "But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.", "There's even a designer rendition with a snakeskin lapel for those so inclined to spend a little more.", "Topshop 'Jenny' Satin Peplum Blazer at Nordstrom .", "Visit site .", "Forever 21 Metallic Satin Blazer .", "Visit site .", "Missguided Satin Lapel Longline Tuxedo Blazer (now $30)", "Visit site .", "Stella McCartney Rhea satin blazer at The Outnet (now $784)", "Visit site .", "Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge.", "It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast.", "In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.'", "She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA.", "Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause.", "There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like;

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)If one is to believe lawyers for Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend, his future brother-in-law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain-smoked. The jury in the high-profile trial resumed deliberations Wednesday after deliberating about an hour-and-a-half on Tuesday. The way defense lawyer James Sultan laid it out for the Massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier Tuesday, why would a young man with a $40 million contract kill semi-pro player Odin Lloyd less than a mile from his own home? Why would Hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene? Did those who Sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the National Football League? \"If there was evidence of any reason Aaron would have had to murder Odin Loyd, don't you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks?\" Sultan asked the jury. \"You didn't hear it because it doesn't exist.\" The prosecution, however, portrayed Hernandez as cold, calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention, one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others. Prosecutor William McCauley asked jurors: What was Hernandez talking about a day after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found at a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013? \" 'My endorsements are gone,' \" Hernandez said, according to McCauley said. \"He's not talking about Odin.\" The state's largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and the presentation of more than 400 pieces of evidence. On Monday, Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story in less than a day. In closing arguments the next day, Sultan sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that Hernandez orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt. Even if they found a strong likelihood that Hernandez was involved, the lawyer said, \"That's not enough.\" Sultan tried to implicate Hernandez's co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The defense described Wallace and Ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on PCP, as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage. They're accused of killing Lloyd. \"Did he make all the right decisions? No,\" Sultan said of his client. \"He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something, committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another. Keep in mind, he's not charged with accessory after the fact. ... He's charged with murder ... and that he did not do.\" The prosecution said Wallace and Ortiz were longtime friends of Hernandez, who had complete control of them. McCauley reminded the jury of testimony about Hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies, and Hernandez at times leaving his then 8-month-old child with the two men. \"These guys ... will do whatever he wants,\" the prosecutor said of Hernandez. The motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out, but prosecutors said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They said Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score. McCauley said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone -- such as disrespect -- would easily offend Hernandez. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, testified that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box. The prosecution has said the murder weapon, which has not been recovered, was in the box. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Jenkins said she threw it away in \"a random dumpster\" but could not remember where. Another piece of the state's case was grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park, which is about a mile from Hernandez's home. The video is time-stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving. Hernandez's lawyers showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand. They suggested it was an iPad. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012, almost a year before Lloyd was killed. He will be tried in that case after the Lloyd trial. The jury has not heard about the double shooting.

In the eyes of critics he was a hate figure \u2013 and it was getting to him. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically, and I got myself into a position where I was hunkered down in the Treasury,\u2019 George Osborne drinks a pint of Somerset cider as he is interviewed by Political Editor Simon Walters at The Cotley Inn, near Chard, Somerset . Osborne reflects as we chat at the Cotley Inn in Chard during a break in an Election campaign tour of the South West. \u2018I was saying, look, if people don\u2019t like the plan or whatever, well, you know\u2026 so be it.\u2019 The nadir came when the Chancellor was booed at the Paralympic Games. Worse, it happened in front of his children, Luke and Liberty, now aged 13 and 11. Did he feel he couldn\u2019t take any more? \u2018I never personally felt, erm, low,\u2019 he says slowly, giving a rare glimpse of his emotions. \u2018But I\u2019m not going to pretend it was easy. \u2018The most difficult thing was explaining it to my children \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy conversation to have.\u2019 Osborne has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the Paralympics to being credited with helping to turn Britain's economy around . Osborne did not consider throwing in the towel, but he knew that he had to break out of his Treasury bunker. \u2018I thought, hold on, you cannot do this in this job \u2013 you have to go out and explain yourself, meet people, expose yourself to fresh ideas.\u2019 He gestures with outstretched arms, hands clenched, recalling the moment he got a grip. Since then, confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the Chancellor himself. And he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically. He went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st. On the day of our interview, a national newspaper compared the new-look Osborne to dashing Latin heart-throb actor Antonio Banderas \u2013 quite a change from the days when he was derided as a Regency fop. \u2018It\u2019s definitely moving in the right direction!\u2019 he laughs. More waspish and engaging than David Cameron in private, Osborne has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public. It is one of the reasons he stood aside when Cameron ran for the Tory Party leadership. He is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat \u2013 a basic skill required by modern leaders. His sense of isolation in his early days as Chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife Frances\u2019s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in London instead of moving to Downing Street. They thought it would make it easier to preserve a \u2018normal\u2019 family life.\u00a0It did the opposite. \u2018I never saw the kids or Frances, because I was up so early and back late,\u2019 Osborne says. His morale improved dramatically when the family did move into Downing Street, one of the few U-turns Osborne has made. \u2018I see the children all the time now, in the morning, and I can pop up in the early afternoon if I\u2019m going out in the evening,\u2019 he says cheerily. \u2018I feel very lucky.\u2019 Osborne also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying Britain under Labour will mimic France's course since it voted in socialist Francois Hollande as president . Osborne\u2019s tour of the West Country has been designed to target seats where the Tories are fighting the Lib Dems. At Hawkins Garage in St Austell, Cornwall, to promote the Government\u2019s apprenticeship scheme, the Chancellor was shown by 17-year-old trainee mechanic Dale Wilkes how to drain a car sump. Osborne\u2019s hand ended up drenched in oil. If he had been asked to do it in his \u2018hunkered down\u2019 phase he would have found it torture. Here, with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls, it wasn\u2019t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as Dale passed him a spanner. From St Austell it was back to\u00a0Somerset and Yeovil, where Osborne hopes the Tory candidate will unseat Lib Dem David Laws who was, until two weeks ago, a Coalition colleague. Osborne was such a fan of Laws that when the Coalition was formed in 2010, he made Laws his deputy, stating that he was \u2018put on earth to be Treasury Chief Secretary\u2019. \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t last long in that position!\u2019 hoots Osborne with a fiendish grin. Laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an MPs\u2019 expenses scandal which led to him being painfully \u2018outed\u2019 as gay. Osborne\u2019s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem who succeeded Laws as Osborne\u2019s Treasury deputy, claimed that an unnamed \u2018very senior Tory\u2019 told him: \u2018You take care of the workers, we\u2019ll take care of the bosses.\u2019 Was it Osborne who said it, as many suspected? \u2018No,\u2019 the Chancellor snaps. But if he has rescued the economy and Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are so useless, as he always claims, why aren\u2019t the Conservatives ahead in the polls? Is it time to press the panic button? \u2018The campaign is going as we wanted it to,\u2019 he insists. Really? \u2018Yes. We always thought it would be close.\u2019 Mr Osborne said he never 'personally felt low' about being booed at the Paralympics in 2012, but had to explain it to his children . But Miliband is proving more resilient than the Tories expected. \u2018Only because he\u2019s standing behind podiums in front of Labour supporters,\u2019 he mocks. Tory MPs claim that their party\u2019s campaign lacks passion and that Cameron\u2019s Australian election guru, Lynton Crosby, is too aggressive and too powerful. Osborne stands foursquare behind them: \u2018David Cameron leads this Election campaign from the front.\u2019 It provokes him into showing some passion of his own. \u2018I\u2019m not about to hand over the keys to No 11 to Ed Balls, saying, \u201cGo and wreck all the good work we\u2019ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country.\u201d Absolutely not!\u2019 The one U-turn Osborne has made during the last five years is moving his wife Frances (pictured) and their children to No 11 Downing Street, so he can be closer to them . He says that if Labour wins, Britain will become an economic basket case like France did after socialist Francois Hollande won power. \u2018France is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour, jobs go, debts pile up. People will say, \u201cMy God, Britain is going backward instead of forward.\u201d Osborne is in his stride now, spitting venom. \u2018All this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from Labour about standing up for\u00a0the many not the few\u2026 the people who suffer most when Labour governments screw up the economy are the poorest.\u2019 A measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month Cameron named Osborne as one of three potential successors \u2013 and no one laughed. So would he like to become PM? \u2018I\u2019m not a politician who spends my life thinking, \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d and \u201cWhat when\u2026?\u201d \u2019 Rot, he can be every bit as calculating as Labour\u2019s Machiavellian Peter Mandelson, we tease him. \u2018I\u2019m not rising to that!\u2019 he laughs. Osborne was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his Tatton constituency, combining politics with a family day out. He was accompanied by Frances, a successful author and daughter of former Tory Minister Lord David Howell, and Luke and Liberty. \u2018We\u2019re all really looking forward to the Election. The children are interested in it. My son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones,\u2019 he chuckles. \u2018Then The Voice came on TV and we switched over to that.\u2019 With that, Osborne takes another sip of his Somerset cider, aptly called Thatchers Gold. It slakes Osborne\u2019s thirst for now. But he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the Tories don\u2019t win Election gold on May 7.", "claim": "george osborne drinks a pint of somerset cider as he is interviewed by political

The main reasons for this were said to be 'showing off in front of friends' and 'succumbing to peer pressure and buying things we wouldn't ordinary buy'.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement. But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home. In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business. And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo \u2013 which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses \u2013 has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors. Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s . At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire. At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat. Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale. 'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57. 'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.' He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business . The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss . He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world. 'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away \u2013 but it wasn't a problem. I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.' Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors. Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel. He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean. 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007. 'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.' The four-bedroom home is now on the market for \u00a3599,000. At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building . The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat \u2013 and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s. But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself. In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village. It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own \u2013 the very property that Branson would one day end up converting. Price: \u00a3599,000 . Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson; former Wesleyan chapel in the village where John Wesley gave his first sermon . At the time of his first sermon, Wesley was studying at Oxford University. The Jacobean pulpit in St James the Great bears a plaque commemorating the sermon, which is reputed to have lasted two-and-a-half hours. 'We were looking for a property in South Leigh as we had friends in the area,' says recently separated Rowan, 50 \u2013 a management consultant with two children, Jacob, 15, and Nancy, 13. 'We fell in love with the house the moment we saw it.' Rowan only found out Branson had been a previous owner on his second viewing. 'That undoubtedly increased our interest, especially when we realised what an excellent job he had done converting it into a home, without losing too many of its original features,' said Rowan. 'And the house ticked all the boxes for us. It has lots of space and is conveniently located for the A40, with good access to London.' At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, pictured is the kitchen . The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden . The building is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout it. Features that Branson added include pine banisters and large round windows offering views across surrounding countryside. The property has an en suite and family bathroom, and the master bedroom overlooks the back garden. A studio room could be used as an office or fifth bedroom. The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden. A kitchen and third reception room complete the accommodation. 'We have the benefit of open space, yet it is still cosy and warm due to a large woodburner in one of the reception rooms,' says Rowan. 'I'll definitely miss the place.' Rowan is moving to Witney so that his children can be closer to their schools and friends.", "claim": "sir richard branson converted the old chapel in shipton-on-cherwell, oxfordshire, into a home in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at south leigh in shipton-on-cherwell, oxfordshire. at the time he converted the property, branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from then until the present day, the virgin logo \u2013 which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses.", "cnndm_id": "bae8201fa542f26641a61429764b4aa9a1209c07", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement.", "But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home.", "In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business.", "And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo \u2013 which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses \u2013 has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors.", "Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s .", "At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire.", "At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat.", "Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale.", "'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57.", "'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.'", "He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business .", "The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss .", "He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world.", "'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away \u2013 but it wasn't a problem.", "I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.'", "Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors.", "Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel.", "He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean.", "'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007.", "'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.'", "The four-bedroom home is now on the market for \u00a3599,000.", "At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel .", "The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building .", "The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat \u2013 and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s.", "But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself.", "In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village.", "It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own \u2013 the very property that Branson would one day end up converting.", "Price: \u00a3599,000 .", "Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire .", "Bedrooms: Four .", "Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson;

The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer.

Carol Cole was 17 years old when she disappeared without a trace after running away from a juvenile detention center in Texas in October 1980. In January 1981, police in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, found a teenage girl stabbed nine times in the back and chest stashed under a pile of leaves in the woods out of a dirt road outside Shreveport. For 34 years, Carol's family searched in vain for the troubled teen. At the same time, detectives from Bossier Parish never stopped trying to identity the body they found mutilated in the woods. Coming together: The picture at left is the image used by Carol Cole's family on Craigslist posts across Texas and Louisiana. The image at right is a rendering of 'Bossier Doe' created for a Facebook page posted by detectives in an attempt to identify a body found in January 1981 . Carol Cole escaped from a Texas juvenile jail in October 1980 after moving from Michigan with her mother. Her remains have been found and identified after 34 years . Relieved: Carol Cole's sister, Jeanie Phelps of Kalamazoo, Michigan, (center) with Bossier Sheriff's Lt. Shannon Mack and Sgt. Dave Faulk . Now, social media has brought Carol's family and Louisiana detectives together. In February, DNA confirmed that the body in Louisiana matched missing Carol's DNA, the Detroit News\u00a0reports. New attention to the case has brought forward a potential suspect, as well. John Chesson, who is already in prison for an unrelated murder, is named as a person of interest in Carol's brutal death . Carol's sister Jeanie Phelps\u00a0and her friend posted Craigslist ads across Texas and Louisiana with pictures of the teen, hoping someone might recognize her. At the same time, Bossier Parish Lieutenant Shannon Mack crated a Facebook post for 'Bossier Doe' (Facebook doesn't allow Jane Doe page names). It included a digitally-rendered drawing of the victim based on her skeletal remains. Carol's family aznd Bossier detectives made a connection six days later when Bossier Parish 911 dispatcher Linda Erickson was trolling through Craigslist. Long road: Cole, from Michigan, was eventually found dead in Louisiana. She was last heard from in December 1980 and found dad a month later . These are the shoes that Carol was wearing when she was found dead. Police posted pictures of them in the hopes of jogging the memory of anyone who may have known her . Person of interest: John Chesson has been identified as a possible suspect by his own daughter. He's currently in prison for an unrelated murder . She had seen the Facebook page posted by detectives in her department. When she stumbled across Ms Phelps' Craigslist page, she realized that the rendering of Bossier Doe and picture of Carol looked remarkably similar. 'I can't explain it other than this child was meant to have an identity,' Ms Erikson tells the News. Perhaps even more remarkable, authorities in Bossier and Carol's family had crossed each other's paths some 30 years ago in a failed attempt to find the teen and identify the body. A coroner in the early 1980s examined the remains to see whether they matched Carol's description - but he said they weren't close enough for further investigation. Ms Phelps, Carol's sister, also considered the Bossier remains in the search for her missing sister - but says she must have glossed over them, WOOD-TV reports. All the new attention has also brought forward a potential suspect in Carol's murder. \u00a0Convicted murderer John Chesson's own daughter told the News that media coverage of Carol's case jogged her memories that the teen had been staying at their house in 1980 before she disappeared. Frances LeBlanc says that her father was a violent, abusive man. And he was also the one who claimed to have found Carol's body in the woods and alerted police. Detectives have not filed charges, but say they are investigating whether Chesson murdered the teenager nearly 35 years ago.

The area is famous for its stunning rock formations, deep valleys and ancient subterranean hideouts, which have been carved from volcanic ash rock. The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scroll down for video . Builders in Turkey have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of Cappadocia. \u00a0The city lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress (pictured). Three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen, leading to vast, winding tunnels . The subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of Earth. It lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress and the surrounding area, which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (TOK\u0130). The multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, according to a report in National Geographic. The find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement. A view of the underground city newly discovered in Turkey's Central Anatolian province of Nevsehir, which is famous for fairy chimney rock formations. The city was built from volcanic ash rock . The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scientists have yet to discover all its secret passages . Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.' The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material. The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks. The latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement. Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances.

Like Derinkuyu, the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders, but remains largely unexplored. But this city is far larger, with early estimates suggesting it could be around a third bigger than Derinkuyu. Geophysicists from Nev\u015fehir University recently conducted a systematic study of a 1.5 mile (4 km) area using geophysical resistivity and seismic tomography. The studies suggest the underground corridors may go as deep as 371ft (113 metres), but the exact size remains unknown. Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.'

'Men saw that as a sort of, \"Oh, fantastic! We can f*** anything, however we like, whenever we like! They're up for grabs, boys!\" It was that kind of attitude', she said. Mirren also said  revelations about celebrities from that era, such as Jimmy Savile, did not come as a surprise.

Indeed, the 38-year-old's eyes were fixed on the 69-year-old's decolletage as they posed for photos at their film's Berlin premiere. And the actor's wife, Blake Lively, shared a snap of the flirty moment with her Instagram fans - joking that she had reason to feel jealous. 'Should I be concerned that my husband's never looked at me this way?...' the 27-year-old quipped in the photo's caption on Saturday. Mirren, pictured in the mid 1970s, was speaking ahead of the release of her new film, Woman In Gold . In her Instagram post she called the Oscar-winning actress 'sexy' and noted that her husband of two years took a gander at her cleavage, writing: '#WhereAreThoseEyesWanderingReynolds #HelenMirrenIStheSexiestWomanAlive #WomanInGold.' Speaking to People, Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. 'You know, he makes a girl feel good,' she explained. 'Some guys don't. They're macho and attractive, but they make you feel awkward. 'Ryan just makes you feel so great. He's just so generous in his masculinity. He happens to be hunky and gorgeous and everything as well, but when you get a beautiful combination of the two? He is wonderful.' Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. In Woman In Gold, their on-screen chemistry is apparent as well. It is a real-life story about a Jewish refugee\u2019s battle against the Austrian government to reclaim a family painting stolen by Nazis. The biopic chronicles the heir's 60-year pursuit of Gustav Klimt's painting The Lady in Gold - which now ranks as the fifth most expensive painting ever sold at $135 million . Helen plays Maria Altmann, a woman who was forced to flee her home and life as a socialite in Vienna amid World War II. She enlists young lawyer Randol Schoenberg, played by Ryan, to help her restore her family's past.

Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered .

She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain.

Despite Wolves bouncing back to take a point through Benik Afobe's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a Richard Stearman own goal had given Ipswich a first-half lead, Town's play-off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining. Former Wolves boss McCarthy was delighted with his side's determined display and he said: 'It was a good performance and a good point. It is very pleasing. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were denied three points as rivals Wolves fought back to draw 1-1 on Saturday . 'Wolves were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great, stubborn, belligerent, professional performance - all those horrible words people don't like in football but I do because you win games and win leagues by doing that. 'We are always hard to beat and hard to play against. 'The first thing I said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent, stubborn, hard working, tough, horrible bunch you have turned out to be and I love you and I am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team. It is lovely to have. 'A lot of those qualities are probably the reasons why we are where we are. 'It takes a lot of things to be in the top six and there will be teams below us who are all playing sexy football but we are winning games and we are in the top six and we still have a chance of being promoted. 'So to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it I laugh at them and think it is comical because I think what we do we do well and isn't that what having a job is all about?' Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal . McCarthy, who was sacked by Wolves in February 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club, insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to Molineux. He added: 'I think I am very much liked and respected by the Wolves fans and I love the club and the people here so I don't think I have got anything to prove and I always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back. 'But I have taken the point and I am happy with that.' Although they trailed at the break, Wolves needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when Afobe stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with Nouha Dicko carrying their greatest. McCarthy hails the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of Ipswich players . They could not find a second goal, though, and their play-off hopes are now hanging by a thread. However, coach Kenny Jackett insisted they will not be throwing in the towel. He said: 'It is out of our hands and now we will need to win our final two games and other teams will need to lose. But you don't know what will happen. So we need to make sure that we go again next week. 'It is a tough call, we understand that. We will have to see how the table looks but one way or another we have to put in a good performance and give it everything we have got next week at Wigan. Kenny Jackett is still hopeful his Wolves side can secure a Championship play-off spot despite the 1-1 draw . 'If the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there.' He added: 'We gave it everything against Ipswich. I thought that we showed a lot of spirit, effort and energy in the second half when we pushed Ipswich all the way. The attitude and tempo was there.' 'Ultimately it is a better point for Ipswich than it is for us. We needed to win and I felt that we built up very well in the second half. We got a goal back early on but couldn't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute Ipswich defence.

Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She\u2019s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Scroll down for video . She's back! Britt McHenry (left) has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she\u2019s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn\u2019t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I\u2019m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding:\u00a0'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026 with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports. When the bar shuts at 2am, the private towing company, Advanced Towing, within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot. The firm showed\u00a0magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to\u00a0suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry.

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.", "claim": "anuradha koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in kathmandu. the public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food.", "cnndm_id": "dae2675302d92bdf0bbd6d35c3e473389f8bb5a1", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal.", "And they are struggling in the aftermath.", "Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls.", "While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12.", "The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry.", "\"We are suffering with rain, strong wind.", "The fear is not gone from us.", "It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year.", "The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera.", "Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food.", "Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster.", "\"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said.", "\"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse.", "Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything.", "...", "If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\"", "About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled.", "Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard.", "\"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said.", "\"Everything is broken in the hospice.\"", "Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged.", "\"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said.", "\"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it.", "I was not afraid that I was going to be killed.", "I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\"", "Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence.", "They are now living on the ground in a nearby field.", "\"Physically, we are not hurt.", "But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated.", "Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down.", "She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves.", "\"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said.", "\"We are really scared.\"", "They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says.", "But she is trying to stay positive.", "\"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?

Mr Kerr told how he suffered abuse at Kincora children\u2019s home in Belfast, where victims have accused MI5 of blocking police inquiries. He said he and two other boys were then trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse in two locations. He said he endured his most violent ordeal at Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London.

Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' TV rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as Matchroom are tied to Sky Sports, while Frampton\u2019s recent title defence against Chris Avalos attracted millions of viewers between ITV in the UK and UTV Ireland.

The Cyclone statement added: \u2018If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.\u2019 Hearn countered the Cyclone statement, telling Sportsmail: \u2018We just want to get it done, it\u2019s so frustrating\u2026 I know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that\u2019s because it was getting nowhere. We\u2019re trying to make things happen. \u2018The only thing that Cyclone Promotions want is they want to co-promote the show. We\u2019re bringing all the money, we\u2019re putting all the money up,\u2019 said the Matchroom promoter. \u2018If there was another broadcaster that they were willing to work with, who could throw a load of money at this fight, then make us an offer.

The blue Audi pulls out from Whitchurch road, in Chester and accelerates into the side of the bus . It then collides into the bus as part of the \u00a31million 'crash for cash' scam that took place over three years . The elaborate fraud allowed passengers on the bus, who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam, to falsely claim from insurers . Smith, the managing director of Swift Accident Solutions, stage-managed the crashes around the Chester area over the three-year period, in a bid to create new claimants for his business. He then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than \u00a31million - to no win no fee lawyers. All of the bogus claims submitted by the Smith's company were for whiplash and 'soft tissue injuries,' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies. Instead, insurers were forced to rely on the individual claimants and usually settled out of court. John Smith (right), 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales is facing jail after stage-managing several collisions in a \u00a31m 'crash for cash' fraud; Luke McQuillan (left) was found guilty of\u00a0of conspiracy to commit fraud . Police uncovered Smith's plot after being alerted by First Direct insurance to the unusually high volume of claims. They also found more than 90 per cent\u00a0of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another. The majority were friends or relatives of the 12 defendants, the court was told. The court heard how Smith had introduced 177 new claimants to a lawyer for which he received \u00a3960 each time. Investigators later found that the bogus claims accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total gross income at Swift Accident Solutions during the period. Smith was convicted yesterday at Manchester Crown Court Smith of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, following a 41-day trial. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud. Four more people had already pleaded guilty to the charge, while two defendants were found not guilty.\u00a0Police believe more arrests will still be made over the scam. During the trial, the court was told how Smith masterminded the scam by finding drivers who were willing to carry out a fake crash. More than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another and were mainly said to be friends and relatives of the 12 defendants. Pictured: Richard Flynn (left) and Barry Cooper (right) were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud following the 41-day trial at Manchester Crown Court . The drivers would then pull out at low speed, using vehicles provided by Smith, and collide with the buses. The single and double decker buses had been chosen out of 'greed' because of the sheer number of claims that could be lodged, the court was told. Bus driver John Griffths told the court how he was caught up in one of the accidents while driving a park and ride bus towards Chester in June 2011. He told how he broke gently when he saw the Rover car pulling out of the side road, in a bid to prevent his standing passengers from being flung along the aisle. He added: 'I couldn't brake harshly because I had standing passengers, if I'd have done that they would have gone forward, so I had to go gently. The driver of the car said it was his fault, that his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator.' But he said one woman quickly reported that she 'wasn't feeling well'. He was also approached by three men, one of whom claimed he had hurt his leg on the bus steps, despite having no visible sign of injury. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud including Dean Brown, 42, (left) and Barry Cooper, 35 (right) When an ambulance was called to the scene, treatment was declined, he added. A passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the Rover driver, at a side junction, actually looking at the bus just before to the collision. Although there was a 'minimal jolt', a fellow passenger was overheard exclaiming 'oh my back', he said. Smith was also accused of making a false representation by not declaring two outstanding county court judgments when applying for a licence to operate his claims management business. After the case Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale from Chester CID said the force would continue to investigate the case. He said: 'This was an extremely complex investigation spanning nearly three years and involving a large number of defendants. 'It has been a challenging process for all officers involved and has required considerable professional skills in relation to the investigation and the subsequent prosecution. 'As part of our investigation conducted a significant number of interviews, to gather the required evidence to prove that Smith and his associates had stage these collisions for the sole purpose of financial gain. 'The crime that they committed was not a victimless crime, had all of the false claims created by Smith and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been over \u00a31 million, which would have been paid for by law abiding citizens through their car insurance policies.' Det Con Stephen Owens added: 'The Police have a duty to protect life, and although these collisions were all minor, they could have been much more serious. 'Yet despite the fact all of the collisions were minor, with minimal damage to both vehicles, they all resulted in multiple claims for personal injury claims, with the vast majority of these claims submitted via Smiths company.

'Through our investigations and the evidence we have gathered, we have been able to identify a \"passenger Network\" which shows that a large proportion of the claimants can be linked to each other. This network proves that over 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions are linked to each other. 'Although the trial against these defendants has now concluded, we will continue to investigate this case and further arrests are likely.'

{"filename": "test_see17_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was \u2018heavily geared\u2019 towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start \u2018shedding\u2019 jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could \u2018go stale\u2019 with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 \u2013 and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a \u2018job for life\u2019 meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly \u2018reskill\u2019 and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: \u2018The old model of training in youth and a \"career for life\" thereafter no longer applies\u2019. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master\u2019s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a \u2018lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks\u2019. Education:\u00a0A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification .

The spectacular isolated fort, one of three guarding the entrance to the Solent, just off the coast of the Isle of Wight, has been turned into a luxury impregnable haven complete with a rooftop hot tub, shops and even its own nightclub, thanks to a multi-million pound revamp. The unique hotel looks like could be a fortress of a James Bond villain and can sleep 44 guests with a capacity of 200 for parties and events. Scroll down for video . For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck for ocean views . The No Man's Fort has been transformed by AmaZing Venues to become a luxury hotel, and is set to open on April 23 . With four floors packed with a variety of entertaining facilities, it\u2019s a unique location that\u2019s sure to leave guests with unforgettable memories . The sea fort is located 2km out at sea, meaning guests have to make an exciting entrance by helicopter or by boat. On arrival at the ocean hotspot, guests can hit up the shops, restaurants, luxury spa, rooftop bar and firepit, cabaret bar, nightclub or LaZer Battle Arena. If water sports are more your style this is the perfect base for enjoying\u00a0RIB rides, jet biking, sea kayaking, or kite surfing. A spokesman for AmaZing Venues said: 'No Man's Fort is an inspiring private island that offers an unrivalled experience. 'It is three times the size of Spitbank Fort and boasts its own lighthouse with spectacular views across the Solent. 'You'd think being a mile offshore is unique enough, but we've crammed every possible space with unusual things to see and experience. Built between 1867 and 1880, No Man's Fort was one of several forts ordered by then-Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to fend off the French Navy. It needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. At the time it cost \u00a3462,500 to build, which with inflation would be equivalent to more than \u00a343million today. It was the first fort in England, and possibly Europe, to use hydraulic power to move the guns in horizontal and vertical planes for targeting and the first to be lighted throughout with electricity. The fort was in active use by the military up to 1957 - housing anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War - and became a scheduled ancient monument in 1967. A developer bought it in 1987 to convert it into a luxury residence but failed to find a millionaire buyer. Birmingham businessman Harmesh Pooni bought it to run as as a corporate hospitality venue but he ran into financial difficulties and had to close down. He eventually barricaded himself inside until he was removed. The fort eventually sold in 2009 for just \u00a3910,000. 'The potential of this magnificent sea fortress is only restrained by your imagination. 'A trip to the fort can be as relaxing or action-packed as you wish. 'For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck.' Described on the website as '75,000 sq ft of fun,' adventurers can unwind overlooking the spectacular rooftop views, whilst enjoying a BBQ, before retiring to one of the 23 luxury suites which cost \u00a3450 per night. Those who have the means to splash out on the best suite in the fort, the plush lighthouse facilities can cost \u00a31,150 a night during the summer. Bond villain haven! The modern fort has two helipad zones, as well as offering roof top BBQ facilities for an ocean-facing meal . Do not disturb! The fort boasts 23 luxury suites and can sleep 44 guests, with prices ranging from \u00a3450 per night . A room with a view! Not only does this hotel offer one of the most private hotel stays, but also incredible ocean views . The unusual destination boasts a colourful history and was even featured in the 1971 Dr Who episode, The Sea Devils, with Jon Pertwee. Built between 1867 and 1880, it was originally used to defend the coast against French invasion, and was used during both world wars to protect Portsmouth Harbour from attacks. In order to construct the impressive fort, huge blocks of granite were transported by barge to the site, and were lowered onto the seabed for its foundations. Luxury loo! The hotel has been renovated with many modern activities and facilities for guests to have a comfortable and memorable stay . Views above the atrium roof are spectacular, and guests can enjoy a meal on the roof overlooking the beautiful coast off the Isle of Wight . The thick 60ft-high concrete walls mean guests can rest easy knowing the fort can withstand any ocean waves crashing again its sides. While it would have cost about \u00a3462,500 to build when it was first created, inflation would equate to that figure being closer to \u00a343million today. AmaZing Venues forked out \u00a33million in first transforming sister venue, Spitbank Fort, which opened in 2012, with this venture being three times as big.

Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. \"If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,\" Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: \"Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion.\" \"Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza\" tweeted A\u10e6anda. \"Just mock them for their ignorance.\" Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. \"Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!\" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  \"Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business.\" Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. \"Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?\" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads \"bigots.\" Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. \"Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?\" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. \"Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses,\" said a tweet from Victor Nikki. \"What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob,\" tweeted Savannah. \"Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere.\" Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is \"to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith,\" according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. \"That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual,\" Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. \"You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be.\" Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

Tomorrow will see mist and low cloud disperse from most parts of Britain in the morning to leave a bright day with sunny spells and patchy cloud. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said yesterday: 'It is definitely very warm for this time of year as it should be around 12C (54F).'

The unseasonably high temperatures last week saw highs of more than 25C (77F) in the South East - nearly double the average for this time of year. And forecasters warned that initial figures suggest that so far this month Britain has only seen 35 per cent of the average rainfall for April. The dry spell follows months of below-average rainfall and conditions are not expected to bring significant showers before May's arrival. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said: \u2018We are over halfway through the month but we've had around a third of the rainfall we get on average. \u2018Over the next week temperatures are going to stay above average for most parts of the country, with the high pressure lasting until the weekend.\u2019 Weather data for the year so far shows national rain fall has been significantly lower than average nearly every month.

Louis van Gaal's side have beaten Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks to enhance their chances of finishing in the top four and changing what looked like a difficult first campaign for the Dutchman into a relatively successful one. After a memorable 4-2 win over local rivals and reigning champions City on Sunday, United face a stern examination at Stamford Bridge. Gary Neville believes Manchester United have a good chance of beating Chelsea with the form they're in . Neville knows United have played well in recent weeks but admits Van Gaal's system and squad will be pushed to the limit against a Chelsea side looking to move one step closer to the title. 'The tests have been Liverpool and City,' he told Press Association Sport. 'This is another test. They have proven themselves, but this is the best team in the country and to go to Stamford Bridge is the toughest test.

Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from. Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June. Manchester City's tenacious, \u00a0creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea) At 36 years old, he is no spring chicken, but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side. Tremmel has played second fiddle to Michel Vorm and then Lukasz Fabianski during his four years at Swansea, but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the Swans beat Bradford in the Capital One Cup final two years ago. Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel, 36, is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - Glen Johnson (Liverpool) England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool, but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer. Johnson, who has 54 England caps, is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books. England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup looks set to leave Liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - Kolo Toure (Liverpool) Another regular at Liverpool who is still to extend his contract. Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November, but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club. Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool . Centre-back - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows, especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him. Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season. At 30, he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams. Holland's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa . Left-back - Luke Garbutt (Everton) Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal, but he is yet to put pen to paper. The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere. Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he's yet to commit . Right wing - James Milner (Manchester City) Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer, Milner has 15 years' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps. Milner is both tenacious and creative, either in the centre of midfield or out wide, and he is still a year off his 30th birthday. Milner has 15 years in top flight experience, 53 England caps and still isn't 30, so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Named Arsenal captain last summer, but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury. Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return. May be 33, but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist. Mikel Arteta hasn't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin . Central midfield - Tom Cleverley (Manchester United) Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer, Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal. 'I think I'm going to be his type of player,' he said. But alas, that did not prove to be the case. The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa, where he has played 30 times. He is not wanted back at United. Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international. Unwanted by Manchester United, Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley . Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez (Newcastle) Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month, but is no longer wanted by his club. Will be 32 in the summer, but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him. Testicular cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere, even if it isn't Newcastle . Striker - Danny Ings (Burnley) One of a number of young English strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for Burnley this season. Rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United and their neighbours City, as well as David Moyes' Real Sociedad. Manchester United and City are said to be interested in Burnley's dangerous striker Danny Ings . Striker - James Wilson (Manchester United) Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under Ryan Giggs against Hull. The 19-year-old has played 16 times under Van Gaal, but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close, the United academy product is yet to agree terms.

There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence. Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women .

Detectives have issued a photo of a brown haired, Caucasian male wearing a black top who they want to speak to after  a fire was started at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2.15am on  April 1. Victoria Police said: 'Detectives have released a FACE image of a man that may be able to assist with their enquiries.' Dandenong Crime Investigation Unit detectives are yet to determine the exact cause of the fire which is being treated as suspicious. The Dandenong fire was one of a string of suspected arson attacks on three Melbourne Catholic churches with links to paedophile priests. The church is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased convicted paedophile Father Kevin O'Donnell. Police have released an image of a bearded young man they want to speak to in relation to a suspected arson attack on a Catholic church in Melbourne . Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious . Police are investigating whether the blaze is connected to two separate suspicious blazes that were lit two days before at St James Catholic Church in Brighton and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda, where paedophile priest Ronald Pickering served as minister. St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong\u00a0is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased Father Kevin O'Donnell . On April 1, it took firefighters 90 minutes to extinguish blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street in Dandenong. Father O'Donnell - who was reportedly known by police as the 'two-a-day man' - was jailed for 15 months in 1995 after he admitted to abusing\u00a010 boys and two girls. He is believed to have committed hundreds of sexual assaults against  young girls and boys over the 50 years that he worked in Victorian Catholic churches, before he retired in 1992. He died in 1997. At the Dandenong church in 1958 Father O'Donnell allegedly molested a 15-year-old boy in the presbytery and went on to sexually abuse his brother, sister and friends,\u00a0The Age reported. He presided over the church from 1958 to 1986, before moving onto Oakleigh. On March 30,\u00a0heritage-listed St James Catholic Church in Brighton was mostly destroyed by fire and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda was found with a small amount fire damage to a door. Bishop Peter Elliott told 3AW Catholic churches would be increasing their security, and said he did not believe the fires were lit by sex abuse victims. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths said she was 'quite elated' when she heard the 124-year-old James Catholic church  had been destroyed by fire. Firefighters extinguished blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street . The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church's former parishioners she found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the  building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it was left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by 'tragedy and complicated feelings' and described it as being known locally as 'the haunted house on the hill'. 'We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,' she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D'Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D'Brass said: 'Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. 'I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: 'I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. 'He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. 'One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.' Many of the church's former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. 'MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: 'You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.' 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos.\u00a0And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: 'Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.' Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails. The pipe organ by Alfred Fuller of Kew, placed centrally in the rear gallery, is a rare example of his work'. Investigators are keen to speak to anyone that may have seen any suspicious activity in the area. Police are urging anyone with information about the fire to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au to make a confidential report.", "claim": "detectives have

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "He has just been given licence to pick one of the finest backs of the era for the World Cup, but Michael Cheika is more pre-occupied with the denigration of his Wallaby pack. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau could be a glorious asset at the showpiece tournament after Australia\u2019s policy against picking players based abroad was relaxed this week, but one thing he can\u2019t do is anchor the scrum. The national coach refuses to bite back, but he has evidently noted and logged claims from these parts that his forwards will be cannon fodder for their English and Welsh rivals, amid the three-way tussle for qualification from daunting Pool A. Australia head coach Michael Cheika is aware that his pack is being written off for the World Cup . Cheika's side will face England and Wales in crunch pool games at the tournament in September . England's pack demolished Australia at scrum-time during last November's 26-17 victory at Twickenham . In fact, many of the claims have come from these pages. Speaking to Sportsmail from Sydney, Cheika repeatedly name-checked a certain knight of the realm and columnist of this newspaper, among the voices arguing that the green-and-gold pack will be smashed into submission. \u2018It has been pretty well reported here that Clive Woodward and others have said that England are going to take us apart in the forwards,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been hearing. I understand that they will have a lot of confidence in their forwards to take us on, but I think you discount the English backs at your peril, because they have some very powerful runners. In Ben Youngs, Care and Wigglesworth, they have three half-backs who will challenge the line every time. \u2018Joseph looks like a nice player and they\u2019ve got some good options in midfield now.

But his repeated references to the pre-tournament dismissal of his pack suggest that there will be a strong emphasis on the set piece in particular during the World Cup countdown over the summer. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau (left) is set to feature for the Wallabies at the World Cup . \u2018Commentators in the UK are saying we won\u2019t be able to match it with England and Wales in the forwards,\u2019 he reiterated. \u2018They\u2019re saying that it\u2019s a shame to waste the talent in our backs. There\u2019s been a fair bit of that coming out, but we\u2019re working hard to make up ground in that area. \u2018Clive Woodward \u2013 who is not just your average spectator \u2013 says we won\u2019t be able to compete with the English scrum.

Most people are looking at us as the ones who will be in the most trouble, but we will relish it and enjoy it. \u2018England and Wales will be feeling good about themselves after the Six Nations. The performance by Wales against Italy in their final game was incredible. I was watching it until it was 13-12 and it was the wee small hours here so I went to bed.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Despite countless campaigns, protests and marches, the notion of blaming a victim for their rape remains shockingly high. The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'", "claim": "the biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' initiative aims to stamp out suggestion that a woman can be blamed

The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\". It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President. 'We thought it was going to happen this year. I feel like we\u2019re close \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction. ' Scroll down for video . Kim and Khloe Kardashian laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame during their April 10 visit. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend, Kim Kardashian wrote in an op-ed, 'I would like President Obama to use the word \u201cgenocide.\u201d It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President' Tricky language: President Barack Obama sent an administration official to Armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim and Khloe walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial. They were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Khloe's  Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use last week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff also said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kardashian, who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins\u00a0Kara and Kourtni\u00a0Kardashian, said, 'Now is the time to speak out, and every little bit helps' 'I will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was,' the reality television star said, encouraging Turkey to label the killings as a genocide. 'It\u2019s not the fault of the people who live there now, ' she noted, and 'I think if they recognize it and acknowledge it, everyone can move on. 'I believe in moving on and looking toward a brighter future, but you can\u2019t move on unless you acknowledge the past. To not do so is an act of disrespect.' Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . Kardashian recalled in the op-ed that her family tree would have ended if her grandparents hadn't left Armenia for Los Angeles the year before the armed conflict. 'There are so many people who lost their families, and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking\u2014they should never be forgotten,' she wrote. 'The whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. A million-and-a-half people were brutally massacred, and a country can just pretend like it never happened? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.' While in Armenia, Kardashian and her family visited the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame that honors those countryman who were killed in 1915. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the flame. Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a\u00a0blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it. 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip to her ancestors' homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Khloe also kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Friday  the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters, beating its goal of 200,000 names. Google did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle, however. The White House said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' It announced at the same time that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew would attend a ceremony in Armenia on Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name this year to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed.", "claim": "kim kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' he said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using word. she has used her celebrity since 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. president obama sent an administration official to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre. kim and khloe kardashian laid flowers at the dzidzernagapert armenian genocide monument. historians estimate that 1.5 million armenians were killed by ottoman turks.", "cnndm_id": "12670e6af0ccf95cf8de50f651f0fded33d419b0", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians.", "The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office.", "Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide.", "Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\".", "It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President.", "'We thought it was going to happen this year.", "I feel like we\u2019re close \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.

With Kate's due date is just over three days away, officers were out in force, pulling lamp posts apart as they scoured the area for anything troubling. The police were watched by a small but growing group of royal fans, many of whom had set up camp on a set of benches and had decorated the area with posters and bunting. Scroll down for video . Ready to go: John Loughrey takes a nap on his makeshift bed outside the Lindo Wing in Paddington . Patriotic: Royal fan Terry Hut takes a break on Mr Loughrey's bench . Festive: Mr Hut sits with another veteran royal fan, Margaret Tyler, 71 . Leading the pack was a familiar face, that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Today, he was more concerned about the Queen and her 89th birthday and happily showed off a handmade sign wishing her many happy returns. Along with group of fellow fans, Mr Loughery went on to delight the world's media - many of whom have gathered but have so far had little to do - with a chorus of Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday: Mr Loughrey holds up a sign wishing the Queen a very happy 89th . Serenade: Mr Loughrey, Mr Hut and fellow fans also serenaded the monarch - and the Press - with a song . Decoration: Mr Loughrey and Mr Hut also came prepared with a selection of royal-themed decorations . Something to do: The Press, who have had little to do so far, happily filmed the waiting fans . Nearly there: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured last month, is due to give birth on the 25th April . Also watching proceedings was royal fan Terry Hut, 79, who, in his Union flag suit, umbrella hat and sunglasses, provided the grey London street with a bright splash of colour. Mr Hut, who came prepared with Prince and Princess balloons, is a veteran of several royal births and spent 12 days camping outside the Lindo Wing ahead of Prince George's birth. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Margaret Tyler, 71, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than \u00a310,000. Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a \u00a31,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Memorabilia: Mrs Tyler, who has a royal collection worth \u00a310,000, came prepared with a Kate figurine . Cheerful: Despite their long wait, the group all appeared to be in good spirits .

With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf.

Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland \u2013 specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland\u2019s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the\u00a0Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe\u2019s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya\u2019s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros.

It marks the end of a six-year case, after the teenagers first reported their ordeal to officials at Clatskanie Middle School in Oregon - only to be told to 'suck it up'. Josi Harrison, Laura Lefebvre, and Hailey Walden were all in eighth grade when they claim their high school-age boyfriends lured them into sending nude pictures to their phones. Ordeal: Laura Lefebvre (left) and Josi Harrison (right) are two of three girls who have won a civil claim against their school district for failing to support them after being bullied into sending naked pictures to boyfriends . Traumatic: Hailey Walden, now a straight-A student, left Clatskanie Middle School to escape the harrowing experience after the principal and local police chief said she would be charged for the distribution of photos . After sending one, they were blackmailed into sending more. However, when they sought help from the principal and Clatskanie District police chief, they were told they would be charged with creating and distributing child pornography. On Thursday, two years after filing a civil suit against Clatskanie School District, a judge has ordered that each girl receive $75,000 in damages. All three girls have subsequently moved to new schools. Speaking in December 2013, Hailey Walden told\u00a0KATU: 'We had grown up with each other and he was always the popular cool guy that everyone wanted to date. I was 13, I didn't know. I thought that if I sent him the picture he would think I'm pretty and love me.' In total, she sent him 30 pictures, which then swept the school. However, her mother Billi Leinonen told the station, principal Jeff Baughman and police chief Marvin Hoover 'chuckled' when they brought the case to them. Hoover, she says, started reading Hailey her Miranda rights and said she would be charged. Though no charges were filed against Hailey, she claims the meeting exacerbated her trauma. On Thursday Clatskanie School District, which encapsulates CMHS, was ordered to pay $225,000 to the girls . Josi Harrison and Laura Lefebvre reported similar conflicts with school officials. Along with Hailey, they filed a $2.5 million federal suit against the district in 2013. The judge ordered a reduced payment on the grounds that the school has taken commendable steps to ensure the situation is not repeated. An attorney for one of the girls, Amber Lunsford, told Oregon Live: 'This suit was never about the money. It was about effecting change.' She added: 'Each of the girls accomplished what they wanted.' Reacting to the settlement on Thursday, Josi told\u00a0Fox 12 Oregon: 'I feel like it made me have to fight battles I shouldn\u2019t have to fight, especially at such a young age, but I feel it made me stronger.'

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "We are well versed in the dangers of using sunbeds, with skin cancer preying on the minds of all who expose their skin to the UV rays. But experts have warned the disease is not the only health danger associated with the pursuit of an artificial year-round tan. Those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes. Dermatologist\u00a0Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes . Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up. Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns the virus, and other bacteria, can survive on tanning beds, despite the heat. 'In my practice, I've seen acquired bacterial infections, warts, and herpes infections from tanning beds,' she told Yahoo. She said staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause skin infections, faecal bacteria, the herpes virus and the wart-causing human papillomavirus are all able to withstand the heat of a sunbed to survive. Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down. The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive. When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses. It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware. 'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned. 'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.' Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system. Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users .

During the drunken attack, which was caught on CCTV, Scots Guard Shaun Smith, 25, can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim\u2019s head. His fellow soldier, Welsh Guard Jason Collins, 22, rained blows with his fists on to the man\u2019s body. Scroll down for video . CCTV cameras captured the horrifying attack last April in which soldiers Shaun Smith (left, in black jeans) and Jason Collins (right, bending over), kicked and punched two men repeatedly near their barracks . Collins, 22, (right) has been stationed at Buckingham Palace since the attack. Smith (left), was described as an 'angel' in court by his officer . The soldiers were expected to be jailed for the \u2018deeply unpleasant and inexcusable\u2019 assault. But yesterday a judge at Teesside Crown Court made what even he admitted was an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 decision to let the men walk free. Judge James Hill, QC, said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them. \u2018I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope, as your commanding officers have expressed, that the Army feels able to keep you.\u2019 The furious victim James Wormald \u2013 who was left with the imprint of Smith\u2019s shoe on his forehead \u2013 said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened. \u2018There was absolutely no reason for the attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong. With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck, Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them. A judge rejected their version of events, saying the man seen in the footage (above) posed 'no threat' when they were beating him . \u2018I don\u2019t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries, the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it.\u2019 Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm. Smith was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work. Collins was given a 12-month community order, and both men were each told to pay \u00a31,000 compensation. The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service's sentencing guidelines. With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each, the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years. Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as 'exceptional'. In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised. Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended, while Collins received a 12-month community order. The pair launched the vicious attack after a night\u2019s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April. They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots. They encountered local men Mr Wormald, 25, and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words. Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them \u2013 a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald, a chef. The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald. Their victim runs across a road, trips and falls. Smith, who has a hood covering his face, can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim\u2019s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald\u2019s body. The pair then ran off and hid in a stream, but were caught by the police. Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face. Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James\u2019s Palace since the incident. He is likely to keep his job. Scots Guard Smith was also of previous good character.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will \"fix\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others, a recent study claimed . The implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding, it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders. This is because the genes that make up the people who we are, and the environments in which we are raised cannot be considered independently of each other. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right)\u00a0raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . The research analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. It found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population. In seeking to explain this connection, the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors. This can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together. On the other hand, their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases, with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members. Genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation (46 per cent) than for adult rape (19 per cent). While the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending, it cannot of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved. Dr Mairi Levitt says that\u00a0genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . Putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents. Of course genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment. As can be seen from the percentages above, the largest proportion of cases involved a large, rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour. You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in V\u00e4stmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of saliva from which the researchers extracted DNA. One of the genes examined was Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). This gene is a key enzyme which breaks down and releases energy in brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. The transmitter be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness . 'About 25 per cent of Caucasian men carry the less active variant of MAOA,' explained Professor Sheilagh Hodgins, a researcher at the University of Montreal. 'Among them, those who experience physical abuse in childhood are more likely than those who are not abused to display serious anti-social behaviour from childhood through adulthood.' Separating  nature and nurture may be useful as a model but does not really make sense because research has demonstrated that gene development is affected by the environment. Any report of genes influencing behaviour tends to polarise opinion. Some may welcome the science and see this as confirmation that sex offenders are biologically different from other people and could perhaps be prevented from offending. Others will be concerned about the stigmatisation of family members defined as 'at risk', but still unlikely to offend themselves. Only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at-risk families would mainly target the innocent. So what then might this mean in practical terms? The discovery could perhaps one day lead to the identification of specific genotypes but could or should this affect the way we deal with sex offenders? A genotype has already been identified that increases the risk of violent behaviour in specific environments. Dubbed the 'criminal' or 'warrior' gene, it has in some cases even been used successfully by defence teams in mitigation pleas to avoid the death penalty in the US, or reduce the length of sentences in the US and Italy. It might be thought odd that a convicted murderer, who is at increased risk of offending and therefore presumably more dangerous to the public in the future, would be treated more leniently. Sex offenders, particularly where children are involved, are probably even more stigmatised than other violent criminals so perhaps a genetic defence would not work in their favour. What is clear is that finding genetic influences on behaviour does not affect legal responsibility. It is recognised that there are many genetic, biological and environmental factors that influence behaviour, and it may be harder for all sorts of reasons for some people to refrain from criminal acts than others. Any research that helps us to understand problem behaviours is to be welcomed, but the headline figure \u2013 a genetic link in 40 per cent of cases \u2013 does not tell us that sex offenders 'can't help it' or are different from 'normal' people.

Holly Nicole Solomon (right), now 31, has pleaded guilty to aggravated assault after hitting her husband Daniel (left) with their SUV after learning that he didn't vote in the 2012 presidential election . Bystanders in the parking lot who called police during the 10am Sunday morning row said that Solomon had been slamming the door of her Jeep repeatedly while yelling at her husband. She then is said to have chased him down with the SUV, driving in circles as he tried to hide behind a light pole, according to the\u00a0Arizona Republic. The woman told police that she wanted to scare her spouse by stopping short of him, but accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake and slammed into her husband. He had been running around the parking lot screaming for help as bystanders looked on in terror. There was no indication that she had drugs or alcohol in her system at the time. She had blamed problems in their family on Obama and 'just hated' him, according to her husband.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "There were scenes of jubilation in the Dutch city of Dordrecht today, as flag-waving locals turned out to welcome King Willem-Alexander and his glamorous wife Maxima today. The visit, which kicked off with a pageant aboard a flotilla of boats on the local canal, was part of Willem-Alexander's 48th birthday celebrations. Koningsdag - or King's Day - is a public holiday in the Netherlands and is traditionally marked with a royal procession either in the capital Amsterdam or in one of the country's major cities. Happy family: The Dutch royals celebrated King Willem-Alexander's birthday in Dordrecht . Warm welcome: The Dutch royal couple were all smiles as they meet well-wishers in the trading city . Today, it was the turn of Dordrecht, a city in the south-west of the country, which was once a major trading port, as well as a military hub. Signs of its martial past were thin on the ground today, however, with the streets filled with a sea of joyful humanity, most of whom cheered and waved as the royals floated past. Taking centre stage was Argentina-born Queen Maxima, who opted for a typically eye-catching ensemble of a raspberry pink coat and hat enlivened with a pair of chunky crystal earrings. Also aboard the royal barge, the Dordtevaar, were the couple's three daughters:\u00a0Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange, 11, Princess Alexia, nine, and Princess Ariane, eight. Willem-Alexander's brother Prince Constantijn, 45, was also aboard, as was his 48-year-old wife, Princess Laurentien, who opted for a tailored dress in patriotic bright orange. Is that it? Eldest daughter Princess Catharina-Amalia, 11, cuddles up to her mother during the event . Round of applause: The Queen and the princesses join in with a round of applause for Willem-Alexander . Big arrival: The couple and their three daughters travelled through the city by barge . Family affair: \u00a0The couple was joined by Prince\u00a0Constantijn and his wife Laurentien who wore bright orange . Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in her summery raspberry pink get-up . Matching: The Dutch queen completed her look with a slick of bright pink lipstick and chunky earrings . All smiles: The 43-year-old appeared to be enjoying the occasion and smiled brightly throughout . Echoing their parents and uncle, all three girls smiled and waved at the crowds, most of whom seemed to be enjoying the bright spring sunshine while watching the procession go past. Others used the royal day off to make some extra money, with one enterprising soul setting up a stand that offered selfies with cardboard versions of the Dutch royals for \u20ac1 apiece. Koningsdag is a long-standing Dutch tradition that began in 1890 with Queen Wilhelmina who celebrated her birthday on the 31st August. When her daughter Juliana became Queen, the date was moved to the 30th April - a tradition maintained by her daughter Beatrix, even though her real birthday is the 31st January. Since April 2013, when Willem-Alexander took the throne following his mother's abdication, the holiday has taken place his birthday, the 27th April. The celebrations, which kick off the night before with King's Parties, also include vrijmarkts - flea markets - in most towns and mass consumption of a delicious orange pastry called the tompouce. A right royal selfie! A well-wisher snaps a selfie with the Dutch King and Queen . Royal wave: King Willem-Alexander waves at the crowds during a walk through the city with his children .

King Willem-Alexander talks to the crowds during his visit to\u00a0Dordrecht . Enterprising: This little girl decided to add to her pocket money by selling selfies for\u00a0\u20ac1 apiece .

It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. \"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,\" said Ben with a smile. \"He was sneaky,\" says Shelby. \"Yeah, I wanted to meet her,\" says Ben, \"and that was the best way I could figure out.\" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "The son of Gerry Anderson, the brains behind the original Thunderbirds, has criticised the computer-generated remake for lacking the 'magic' of the classic show. Jamie Anderson said the CGI characters did not have the same charm as the 'lovingly detailed' miniature puppets. Thunderbirds will return to our screens tonight 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects \u2013 real explosions rather than computer-generated ones. 'There is something utterly magical about seeing a puppet come to life under the skilled operation of talented puppeteers. 'Sadly for fans old and new alike, that's not going to be possible with the new series.' Iconic: Gerry Anderson with a model of Thunderbird 1 - his son Jamie has criticised the new CGI characters . Quest: As with the original show, the remake will feature the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world . Thunderbirds aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065. When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet\u00a0their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There is also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget . The iconic children's classic\u00a0aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002 . Jamie Anderson, son of Gerry, said there was something 'utterly magical' about seeing a puppet come to life . The updated version of the iconic show is not the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was a dismal flop, losing almost \u00a320 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show's co-creator, called it 'the biggest load of c**p' he had seen. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a modest budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Peter Jackson's animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics.

The heavily televised events in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Six hostages who hid in a  freezer during the Islamist attacks have sued French media for broadcasting their location live . Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly slaughtered customers during the siege at the Hyper Cacher store. Lawyers claim French media endangered the lives of hostages hiding a freezer by revealing their location live on air . He singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV which revealed live on air that the group - including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby - was hiding  in the freezer. They had been taken to the cold room by one of the supermarket's employees. 'The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime,' Mr Klugman told AFP Thursday, roundly criticising coverage by other outlets of the movements by security forces during the standoff. The lives of those hiding 'could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting,' Klugman said. He added that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists. The lawsuit charges media  with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a \u20ac15,000 (\u00a311,000) fine.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans. Their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs. Over half, 54 per cent, also confessed they did not know that Lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites, affects their pets as well as themselves. Knowledge about Lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives. In extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases - such as Lyme disease - to humans . At the other extreme, symptoms may be so mild that someone who's been bitten by an infected tick may experience only flu-like symptoms. Ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans. Areas of undergrowth (including parks and gardens - as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife. It's why most people are bitten below the waist. With the forecast of increasingly damp winters and hotter summers - ideal conditions for the ticks to thrive - as well as growth in deer numbers, the concern is that the incidence of Lyme disease will rise further. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of Europe and North America. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease which can infect humans . Many people with early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around 3 to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans. Some people with Lyme disease also experience flu-like symptoms in the early stages, such as tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, joint pain,headaches, a high temperature (fever), chills and neck stiffness. More serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on. These can include: . Some of these problems will get better slowly with treatment, although they can persist if treatment is started late. A few people with Lyme disease go on to develop long-term symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. This is known as post-infectious Lyme disease. Source: NHS Choices . The increase in incidence of illnesses such as Lyme is 'a serious' cause for concern and 'ticks will become a very serious public health issue in the UK as a result of climate change', claims Julie Barratt, the director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health. She thinks we need to take a similar approach to avoiding tick-borne disease as we do to sun exposure - covering up and using insect repellent as we would sunscreen. This means taking precautions 'in the great outdoors, whether you're camping, walking in the countryside or in your back garden', she says. Concerned vets across the UK are now urging people to get their dogs checked out for the pests. Any ticks collected by vet practices will be sent to a team of scientists who will examine them for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Professor Richard Wall, from the University of Bristol, will be part of a team studying the ticks, and says their numbers have soared in the last 10 years. He said: 'Current evidence suggests that many tick-borne diseases in northern Europe are increasing in prevalence as a result of factors.' He explained this is due to changes in their habitat, increasing pet travel and climate change. He added: 'Warmer and wetter winters and milder wetter summers, in particular, may allow the normal highly seasonal pattern of tick activity to be extended, giving more continuous periods of exposure. 'In Great Britain the distribution of ticks is estimated to have expanded in the last 10 years by 17 per cent and the abundance of ticks to have increased at 73 per cent of locations surveyed.' Many people do not realise it is possible to catch Lyme disease in Britain. Joanne Drayson, from Guildford, who contracted the illness after being bitten by an infected tick while walking her dog, did not know it was possible to catch it in the UK. She said: 'I was aware of the disease but always thought it was something that was unique to the United States. 'After a long course of antibiotics, I gradually recovered my health. I still enjoy walking in the woods but now I go more prepared. 'It is important to cover up, tuck your trousers in your socks, have long sleeves and when you leave the woodland or countryside to always check for any ticks.' Public Health England estimates the number of new Lyme disease cases each year at around 3,000, while charities say the figure is closer to 15,000. In spite of this, the majority of people are still unaware that the potentially debilitating condition also affects dogs. Lyme disease is caused by a bite from an infected tick. Dogs can become bitten during walks in wooded areas or parkland in both urban and rural areas. Symptoms in dogs include lameness, lethargy and fever, which, if left untreated, can lead to more serious conditions such as kidney disease and heart failure. Many cases of Lyme disease are likely to go unnoticed by owners as they are only detected by a thorough examination. Throughout spring and early summer when ticks are most actives, vets taking part in The Big Tick Project, will be giving dogs visiting their practice a tick check. Ticks collected will be sent off for scientific analysis where they will be examined for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The Big Tick Project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham who wants to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with Lyme disease . The project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham and aims to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with the tick-borne disease. He said: 'Research suggests that ticks are a growing problem whether that's urban parkland to woodland and open country. 'Living as I do in the New Forest where ticks can be a problem and present a real threat to my dogs, this project is close to my heart and could be important in advancing both for canine and human health. 'I know people who have contracted the disease and I cannot begin to imagine how I would feel if my dogs were to catch it too. 'While I find ticks interesting creatures, I don't want them on my dogs, in my house or on me. 'If like me, you love your dogs, you'll want the best advice and treatment to help reduce the risks associated with ticks and tick-borne disease.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club. The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening \u00a3800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . \u2022 Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . \u2022 The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . \u2022 Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . \u2022 The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . \u2022 Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . \u2022 The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres \u2013 on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for \u00a380m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "The family of a murdered mother have spoken of their fury after it was revealed that she tried to call 999 hours before she was killed but call handlers failed to alert police. Karen Catherall, 45, was viciously beaten and strangled to death by Darren Jeffreys, who she met only weeks earlier on dating site Plenty of Fish. The pair had been drinking at the pub before she returned to her home in Gwernaffield near Mold, Flintshire, North Wales, when Jeffreys, 47, followed and attacked in an alcohol-fuelled rage. Scroll down for video . Karen Catherall, 45, (right) was brutally murdered by Darren Jefferys (left) who she met on a dating site just weeks before her death. He was jailed for a minimum of 17 and a half years in February . He only called paramedics the following morning and claimed he thought Ms Catherall was sleeping, but later admitted murder and was jailed for life in February. Police have since told the family that the mother-of-two made a 999 call from her mobile just after she returned from the pub, which went through to BT to deal with. Operators at the telecommunications company connects both mobile and landline numbers with the requested emergency service and follow strict protocol. But when Ms Catherall called on September 13, last year, the call handler said they could not hear anything and therefore did not connect the call to the police or send help. Her mother, Glenys Keir, 74, and sister Lorraine Humphreys, 49, have slammed BT for not taking action at the time which they claim could have saved their sister. However, BT says its handlers acted appropriately and in line with police guidance not to pass on calls where there is 'nothing to indicate there is any problem'. Mrs Keir said: 'When we found out Karen had been murdered our whole world fell apart. 'But as we were starting to come to terms with it all, to then hear that a 999 call had been made from her mobile the night she died, it stirred up all of those emotions we had felt when we first found out Karen had been killed. Her family (mother, Glenys Keir, left, and sister, Lorraine Humphreys, right) were told by police that she had tried to make a 999 call just hours before her murder but the call was ended when operated got no response . Ms Catherall (left) had been drinking in the pub with Jeffreys (right) when he followed her home on September 13, last year. He didn't call paramedics until the following morning, claiming he thought she was asleep . 'It left us feeling sick to the stomach, devastated and fuming, knowing no one was there for Karen when she needed help. 'If they had got to her in time Karen might still be alive. She could have been here today. Now we'll always wonder if that may have been possible.' Police confirmed a 999 call was made from her mobile phone to BT  at around 7pm but it was disconnected after around 13 seconds and officers were not informed. Glenys Kier and her partner Esmor Evans leaving Mold Crown Court following the trial of their daughter's killer, Darren Jeffreys . The phone call was later enhanced by detectives, who discovered arguing could be heard in the background. Ms Catherall's family are calling on BT to review their procedures, and answer questions about the call. Mrs Keir said: 'Apparently the person who picked up believed there was silence at the end of the line. They must have assumed 999 had been dialled accidentally. 'It doesn't bear thinking about what might have happened if BT had connected the call to the police.' Ms Catherall's sister, Mrs Humphreys, a catering supervisor, added: 'You regularly hear of toddlers playing with their mum's mobile phone and ringing the emergency services by mistake. 'In those instances, the police often seem to trace the call and turn up on the doorstep. 'We want to know why that didn't happen when in this situation Karen so desperately needed their help. 'We know the police aren't to blame as they never received the call, but BT should be looking into this and reviewing their policies. 'The call might have been muffled or quiet at the other end of the line, but surely it's better to put it through to the police so they can send an officer and be safe rather than sorry. 'Who knows what the outcome might have been if they had reached her in time? We don't want any other families to lose a loved one and go through the pain we have.' A BT spokesman said: 'North Wales Police contacted BT on September 24, 2014 about whether we received an emergency call from a mobile phone number and we provided them with full details including a call recording. 'Our records show that we received the call at approximately 19.07 on September 13, 2014. 'There was no response to our operator's questioning and our operator heard nothing to indicate there was any problem before the caller ended the call after about 13 seconds. 'Police forces have requested that we do not connect such calls to them and our operator correctly followed the call handling process requested by the police.' Ms Catherall's family (pictured outside court) are calling on BT to review their procedures following the call . The 999 emergency number was set up in London in June 1937 after five women were killed in a fire. A committee discussed how telephone operators could identify emergency calls and the easy to remember 999 number was born. It was later rolled out in Glasgow and extended to all major towns and cities by 1948. Since then it has expanded massively with an average of 597,000 calls a week across the UK. BT operators answer the initial call from both landlines and mobiles and find out which emergency service is required before connecting the caller. The handler has to quickly establish whether the call is genuine before transferring them. In instances where they are met with silence they ask the caller to respond by either making a noise or coughing. This can narrow down the number of accidental or prank calls made, which account for about half of the 31 million calls made annually. Of the remaining 15.5million, 52 per cent go to police, 41 per cent to ambulance service, six per cent for fire and one per cent to the coastguard and cave and mountain rescue services. The spokesman also explained that in cases where they get no response from the caller, the operator will ask whether they can make a noise or cough. In this instance Ms Catherall apparently made no response and the phone call was terminated. Detective Inspector Mark Hughes, senior investigating officer at North Wales Police, confirmed the call. He said: 'During the early evening of September 13, 2014, a 999 call was made from the mobile phone of Karen Catherall. 'The phone call was received by the telephone company operator and managed in accordance with their policy but not directed onto North Wales Police, nor in fact any police force. 'I understand the circumstances surrounding the management of this phone call are now being reviewed by the Telephone Company following a request by Karen's family.' It was not until the early hours of the following morning, at 2.35am, that Jeffeys called emergency services, claiming that he thought she was sleeping off the alcohol and he was unable to wake her. But paramedics who arrived at the house found she had been dead for some time and there was also evidence he had tried to cover up the killing, Mold Crown Court was told. A post mortem examination revealed that her cause of death had been blunt force trauma to the head and asphyxiation. Jeffreys had denied killing his girlfriend when interviewed by police, but in December last year admitted the murder. Mr Justice Wyn Williams, hearing the case, said Jeffreys subjected Ms Catherall 'to a ferocious, sustained and in the end deadly attack'.

Yaya Toure grabbed one back for the visitors, but it wasn't enough to stop City from losing further ground on league leaders Chelsea. Here, SportsMail's\u00a0Sami Mokbel takes us through the key moments of the match. Thought Manchester City players didn't crowd referees, Manuel?

Charlene Bishop, who is 17 months old, went to feed her pony Taffee on Wednesday and was worried when she didn't meet her at the gate as normal. Her mother Danielle Flisher went to investigate and found the Shetland lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries. Sickening: Taffee the Shetland pony was\u00a0battered to death with a breeze block in the middle of the night in a brutal attack .

She can't do the same things as everyone else, but she loved spending time with me at the yard and had Taffee to keep her happy. 'They weren't together long but they were amazing. Charlene would climb all over her and Taffee wouldn't mind. 'Charlene would even sometimes tell Taffee off and the pony would go and stand in the corner of the stable like a naughty child. 'She's lost her best friend and she's devastated.' Taffee had a foal, 10-month-old Biscuit, who the family are now in the process of finding a surrogate mother for.

The\u00a0Conservatives yesterday returned a donation of \u00a350,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But last night it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. The revelation by the Independent newspaper will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe. Last week his party's manifesto pledged to raise \u00a35 billion from clamping down on tax avoidance during the next Parliament. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans. Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.' Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than \u00a350,000 to the Conservatives. She and her husband were close friends of Margaret Thatcher and were guests of the Reagans at the White House. In his memoirs, her husband said he only pleaded guilty to get the US authorities to leave his family in peace. The revelation  will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe . He wrote: 'It was galling to listen to these vast sums of money being referred to as though they were merely numbers and to the fact that I had agreed to hand all this money to the US Government. 'But the future peace and security of the family which this agreement would secure meant that I could see advantage in what I was about to do. But that did not make it right.' A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Tollman told the Independent: 'In so far as Mrs Tollman is concerned you will see she is of good character and was acquitted of all charges.' Responding to Mr Tollman's guilty plea, a spokesman said: 'Stanley Tollman admitted to having failed to report on his US tax return two bank accounts situated outside the US. It was that omission for which he was sentenced to one day's unsupervised probation. 'The reality is that the financial settlement was the only means through which his family were going to be able to get on and lead their lives without being coerced by the Americans.'", "claim": "beatrice tollman made her most recent donation to the tories earlier this month. she has been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed. he was sentenced to more than two years in prison. stanley tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion.", "cnndm_id": "7408e6418b4629220489452532a4ab98ced1d614", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers .", "The\u00a0Conservatives yesterday returned a donation of \u00a350,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges.", "Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers.", "But last night it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge.", "However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion.", "Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands.", "The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty.", "The revelation by the Independent newspaper will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe.", "Last week his party's manifesto pledged to raise \u00a35 billion from clamping down on tax avoidance during the next Parliament.", "A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans.", "Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.'", "Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than \u00a350,000 to the Conservatives.", "She and her husband were close friends of Margaret Thatcher and were guests of the Reagans at the White House.", "In his memoirs, her husband said he only pleaded guilty to get the US authorities to leave his family in peace.", "The revelation  will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe .", "He wrote: 'It was galling to listen to these vast sums of money being referred to as though they were merely numbers and to the fact that I had agreed to hand all this money to the US Government.", "'But the future peace and security of the family which this agreement would secure meant that I could see advantage in what I was about to do.", "But that did not make it right.'", "A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Tollman told the Independent: 'In so far as Mrs Tollman is concerned you will see she is of good character and was acquitted of all charges.'", "Responding to Mr Tollman's guilty plea, a spokesman said: 'Stanley Tollman admitted to having failed to report on his US tax return two bank accounts situated outside the US.", "It was that omission for which he was sentenced to one day's unsupervised probation.", "'The reality is that the financial settlement was the only means through which his family were going to be able to get on and lead their lives without being coerced by the Americans.'"], "sum_sents": ["beatrice tollman made her most recent donation to the tories earlier this month.", "she has been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed.", "he was sentenced to more than two years in prison.", "stanley tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion."], "rel_index": [0, 3, 4, 6, 20]}

An American transgender woman is preparing to move to the UK to marry a bride she has never met in order to fulfil a 'lifelong dream' of becoming a British citizen.

But now, a young African-American man has released a video disputing claims that all white police officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color', insisting that 'there are good cops out there'. In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Will Stack, a 22-year-old U.S. Army National Guardsman, recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in the state's Lexington County. He explains how he was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse on Wednesday, to make a left turn, when he decided to use the empty median lane to access the left turn lane, which was full. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're bad': Will Stack, 22, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, has released a video (pictured) disputing claims that all white officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color' Moments later, he was stopped by the cop for 'improper use of the median'. 'He told me what I did, asked for my license and registration, I gave that to him,' Mr Stack says in the selfie-style video. He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook\u00a0page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story. Traffic stop: In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Mr Stack recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in South Carolina. He says he was given a warning after doing everything the cop said . Praise: Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented (above) on Mr Stack's selfie-style video, with many praising him for his honesty amid a national scandal over alleged police brutality . Mixed opinion: Although many of the users' comments were positive, others were negative (as seen bottom) 'The point of this is to say that I am an African-American male, this gentleman was Caucasian. There were no problems. He did his job, I did what I was supposed to do, and that was it,' he says. 'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?' Mr Stack captured the video just days after North Charleston officer Michael Slager was arrested for murder for allegedly shooting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away.

He told WIS that although he had concerns over the use of force  applied by Officer Slager, 33, he was keeping an open mind about the shooting - and did not believe Scott should have tried to flee. Speaking to the station, Mr Stack, who recently completed a deployment with the National Guard and is now job hunting, said: ' It's possible for African Americans and police officers to get along. 'And, not everybody shares the same mindset because nobody's the same, everybody's different.' Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented on Mr Stack's video, with many praising him for his honesty amid the national scandal over alleged police\u00a0brutality.

Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor.

Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry .

The campaign videos have been released in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December, sickened 147 people in the U.S., which has seen the debate over vaccination flare up. Officials at the California Department of Public Health said no new infections have been reported for the past 42 days \u2014 or two incubation periods \u2014 meaning the outbreak is over in the U.S. Many who fell ill in the Disneyland episode were not immunized against measles.

In California, where 131 of the 147 measles cases could be found, a vaccination bill has generated intense debates pitting personal rights against public health.

Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, Arkansas, found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas . Clark named the pinto-bean-sized, teardrop-shaped gem a 'hallelujah diamond' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something .

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today. The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon\u00a0that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government. An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow.\u00a0Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ding-dong: Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming \u2014 the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers.

You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems.

The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten \u2018everyday emergencies\u2019 - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "Not only does Gareth Bale definitely want to stay at Real Madrid beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world. Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United . Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters . Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final . He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday . The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes . The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey . The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season . He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas . De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea . De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318million . All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.", "claim": "gareth bale adamant he wants to stay at real madrid. bale is injured and out of wednesday's

In particular, it cited 'alarming reports especially from Western Europe and North America'. Anger in Western Europe over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip last July and August, as well as anti-Jewish caricatures in the media and social networks had helped to turn anti-Semitism into an 'almost daily phenomena seen and felt in every sphere of life', the report said.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Green party leader Natalie Bennett has been forced to distance herself from a bizarre online site run by her boyfriend. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember\u2026 Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.' Another post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil and held in a cellar for . Mr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.' Ms Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for \u00a3249,950 in 2007 in North London. Last night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks. A spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011.

So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area. The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families. And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California. The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m. Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes. One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families. The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments. Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there. However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation. 'He said \"we've got enough millionaires here. What we need is some houses for regular working people\",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS. Scrapped: This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled . Idyllic: The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families . Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, \"if I\u2019m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?\"' It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy. In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "The little girl who broke millions of hearts after surrendering to a camera she mistook for a gun is now in the clutches of Al Qaeda, the MailOnline can exclusively reveal. Four-year-old Hudea was pictured late last year by photographer Osman Sagirli in Atmeh refugee camp, just 10km from the border with Turkey. She, her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the Syrian camp since Hudea's father was killed in the 2012 Hama massacre. But two weeks ago, the family took a fateful decision to move south, towards the city of Idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of Al Qaeda's brutal Syrian affiliate at the weekend. It means, once more, the family are in danger of becoming victims of a battle between the regime and rebels which has killed 220,000 since 2011 - 10,000 of whom were children. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Taken at the Atmeh refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey, the image shows four-year-old Hudea frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed . Hudea and her family left the camp two weeks ago; it is thought they headed for Idlib - now in the control of Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra. Pictured: An Al-Nusra fighter holds his group flag  in front of Idlib's governor building . Sharia law: Al-Nusra have promised to bring in Sharia law in the city, and have already started burning things considered banned under Islam - like these cigarettes . The Nusra Front-led rebels is set impose Sharia law on the city, which is only the second state capital to fall from the grip of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. 'We salute the people of Idlib and their stand with their sons, the Mujahideen, ... and God willing they will enjoy the justice of sharia, which will preserve their religion and their blood,' said Abu Mohamad al-Golani, Nusra Front's leader, in a recording released on Wednesday. This is horrifying news for those living under the Nusra Front. The group\u00a0group has a reputation for violence which is only rivaled by the horrors seen in ISIS-controlled territory. Charlie Winter, of the Qilliam Foundation, warned: 'Jabhat al-Nusra is an outspoken al-Qaeda affiliate. It espouses a severe interpretation of Islam and sharia law. 'They have been known to execute women who are allegedly running brothels, and stone adulterers. It is a violent interpretation of sharia law.' Indeed, the group appears to be all but following in the footsteps of ISIS, who have terrified the world with an onslaught of violence, including throwing people from the tops of buildings and getting small children to shoot so-called spies dead. Worringly, the Nusra Front - who reiterated their allegiance to Al Qaeda in the last month - have said they want to create their own 'Islamic state'. The group is known for its use of suicide bombers as it tries to achieve its goal, and has claimed\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0mass executions, murdered journalists and even priests in the past few years. In the days since they took control of Idlib, there have been reports of two Christian men being executed, while the Vatican - citing local news sources - claimed a Greek Orthodox priest had been kidnapped by jihadists. Fight: The city fell after a four day battle which saw fighters on both sides lose their lives . Flee: It is thought about 15,000 people ran from the city as the Nusra Front approached . Trauma: Save the Children reports many of the children were traumatised by what they had seen . For a child like Hudea, who has clearly already been left horribly traumatised by a war which has been raging her entire life, life under the strict sharia law is likely to be nothing be more terrifying. But life is no better under the Syrian regime: indeed, it is al-Assad's fighters who were said to be behind the Hama massacre in which she lost her father. Pro-government militia killed at least 55 people that day, going from house to house, murdering men, women and children. It was after this the family fled north, to the camp near the border with Turkey, which has grown to become a home to 30,000 refugees. But despite being so close to the safety of Turkey, the family appear to have never made it across. Instead, for reasons unknown to MailOnline's source within the camp, they decided to leave the camp - venturing out into territory which has changed hands between the different rebel factions and the al-Assad regime numerous times over the last four years. The MailOnline's source within the camp said: 'The child does not exist now in the camp. They fled to a village in Idlib about two weeks ago.' Wherever they have gone, it means the family are trapped once more between three violent sides - none of which are prepared to stop until they have wiped the other off the face of the earth. Relative safety: Many of the 15,000 are headed to refugee camps like Atmeh, near the Turkish border - but it is not known where Hudea and her small family are . Civil war: Fighting has been going on Hudea's entire life, killing 10,000 children since 2011. Pictured: Atmeh, her home after he father was killed in 2012 . And living in an area recently won by one side, does not guarantee survival - or peace. A source in the Syrian military force told EA World View: 'We have an obligation to liberate the city... I swear to god the highest we are not scared.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at University of Oklahoma, was also certain Damascus would not give up without a fight. He told\u00a0Bloomberg:\u00a0'Assad will likely bomb Idlib so that its captors find little peace in their new prize.' Mr Winter thinks it is unlikely they will have gone to areas controlled by the Syrian government. One suspects the memory of what they did to her husband will mean Hudea's mother will keep her family away from al-Assad's forces. But villages not in the control of the regime have come under attack since Nusra Front's assault on Idlib - which itself sent 15,000 people fleeing for their lives. Ironically, many are making their way to the refugee camps in the north - like Atmeh, the safe haven Hudea has just left. And now there are reports of the regime using chlorine-filled bombs against the towns\u00a0surrounding\u00a0Idlib - a new horror for the little girl and her family to contend with.

Indeed, the food chain's new Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich - which is described on the Dunkin Donuts website as containing 'delicious breaded chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon and honey mustard' which are all \u00a0'served on an oven-toasted pretzel bun' - contains a whopping 640 calories, almost a third of your recommended daily intake. Additionally, the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale, which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg. The roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake. And when paired with one of Dunkin Donuts' new ice cream-inspired coffee flavors - Rocky Road Swirl, Butter Pecan Swirl, or Cookie Dough Swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal, if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee. Another option listed on the new menu is the Southwest Supreme Bagel, which is stuffed with cheese, corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes, onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake. Something savory: The\u00a0Southwest Supreme Bagel contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt . Healthy? The 210-calorie Snack N\u2019 Go Steak Wrap is intended to be a low-calorie alternative to the other menu options, however it still contains 25 per cent of your daily saturated fat intake . Healthier than the pretzel roll, yes, but still not the most nutritious treat around. Indeed, the only 'healthy' option offered on the new menu is a small Snack N\u2019 Go Steak Wrap, a 210-calorie snack that contains 'our delicious angus steak, a slice of cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce, wrapped in a warm tortilla'. But while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier, low-calorie option, it still contains five grams of saturated fats, which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake. Last, but not least, the menu also contains two new varieties of Dunkin Donuts' signature Cheesecake Square Donut, which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling, this time in Oreo and raspberry flavors. And while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the Dunkin website, the standard Cheesecake Square Donut contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance. Unsurprisingly, the chain's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health-conscious Twitter users to voice their concerns over the calorie-laden choices.

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21. There's even a designer rendition with a snakeskin lapel for those so inclined to spend a little more. Topshop 'Jenny' Satin Peplum Blazer at Nordstrom . Visit site . Forever 21 Metallic Satin Blazer . Visit site . Missguided Satin Lapel Longline Tuxedo Blazer (now $30) Visit site . Stella McCartney Rhea satin blazer at The Outnet (now $784) Visit site . Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.'

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)If one is to believe lawyers for Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend, his future brother-in-law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain-smoked. The jury in the high-profile trial resumed deliberations Wednesday after deliberating about an hour-and-a-half on Tuesday. The way defense lawyer James Sultan laid it out for the Massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier Tuesday, why would a young man with a $40 million contract kill semi-pro player Odin Lloyd less than a mile from his own home? Why would Hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene? Did those who Sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the National Football League? \"If there was evidence of any reason Aaron would have had to murder Odin Loyd, don't you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks?\" Sultan asked the jury. \"You didn't hear it because it doesn't exist.\" The prosecution, however, portrayed Hernandez as cold, calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention, one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others. Prosecutor William McCauley asked jurors: What was Hernandez talking about a day after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found at a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013? \" 'My endorsements are gone,' \" Hernandez said, according to McCauley said. \"He's not talking about Odin.\" The state's largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and the presentation of more than 400 pieces of evidence. On Monday, Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story in less than a day. In closing arguments the next day, Sultan sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that Hernandez orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt. Even if they found a strong likelihood that Hernandez was involved, the lawyer said, \"That's not enough.\" Sultan tried to implicate Hernandez's co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The defense described Wallace and Ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on PCP, as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage. They're accused of killing Lloyd. \"Did he make all the right decisions? No,\" Sultan said of his client. \"He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something, committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another. Keep in mind, he's not charged with accessory after the fact. ... He's charged with murder ... and that he did not do.\" The prosecution said Wallace and Ortiz were longtime friends of Hernandez, who had complete control of them. McCauley reminded the jury of testimony about Hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies, and Hernandez at times leaving his then 8-month-old child with the two men. \"These guys ... will do whatever he wants,\" the prosecutor said of Hernandez. The motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out, but prosecutors said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They said Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score. McCauley said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone -- such as disrespect -- would easily offend Hernandez. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, testified that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box. The prosecution has said the murder weapon, which has not been recovered, was in the box. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Jenkins said she threw it away in \"a random dumpster\" but could not remember where. Another piece of the state's case was grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park, which is about a mile from Hernandez's home. The video is time-stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving. Hernandez's lawyers showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand. They suggested it was an iPad. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012, almost a year before Lloyd was killed. He will be tried in that case after the Lloyd trial. The jury has not heard about the double shooting.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Watching George Osborne enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider and a chat with the locals in a Somerset pub garden, it is hard to believe that only three years ago he was virtually scared to leave the safety of his Treasury office. He felt besieged and intimidated. There was little evidence his hardline \u2018austerity Britain\u2019 policies were working. His nervy demeanour and pallid complexion reflected the sickly economy. In the eyes of critics he was a hate figure \u2013 and it was getting to him. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically, and I got myself into a position where I was hunkered down in the Treasury,\u2019 George Osborne drinks a pint of Somerset cider as he is interviewed by Political Editor Simon Walters at The Cotley Inn, near Chard, Somerset . Osborne reflects as we chat at the Cotley Inn in Chard during a break in an Election campaign tour of the South West. \u2018I was saying, look, if people don\u2019t like the plan or whatever, well, you know\u2026 so be it.\u2019 The nadir came when the Chancellor was booed at the Paralympic Games. Worse, it happened in front of his children, Luke and Liberty, now aged 13 and 11. Did he feel he couldn\u2019t take any more? \u2018I never personally felt, erm, low,\u2019 he says slowly, giving a rare glimpse of his emotions. \u2018But I\u2019m not going to pretend it was easy. \u2018The most difficult thing was explaining it to my children \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy conversation to have.\u2019 Osborne has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the Paralympics to being credited with helping to turn Britain's economy around . Osborne did not consider throwing in the towel, but he knew that he had to break out of his Treasury bunker. \u2018I thought, hold on, you cannot do this in this job \u2013 you have to go out and explain yourself, meet people, expose yourself to fresh ideas.\u2019 He gestures with outstretched arms, hands clenched, recalling the moment he got a grip. Since then, confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the Chancellor himself. And he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically. He went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st. On the day of our interview, a national newspaper compared the new-look Osborne to dashing Latin heart-throb actor Antonio Banderas \u2013 quite a change from the days when he was derided as a Regency fop. \u2018It\u2019s definitely moving in the right direction!\u2019 he laughs. More waspish and engaging than David Cameron in private, Osborne has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public. It is one of the reasons he stood aside when Cameron ran for the Tory Party leadership. He is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat \u2013 a basic skill required by modern leaders. His sense of isolation in his early days as Chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife Frances\u2019s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in London instead of moving to Downing Street. They thought it would make it easier to preserve a \u2018normal\u2019 family life.\u00a0It did the opposite. \u2018I never saw the kids or Frances, because I was up so early and back late,\u2019 Osborne says. His morale improved dramatically when the family did move into Downing Street, one of the few U-turns Osborne has made. \u2018I see the children all the time now, in the morning, and I can pop up in the early afternoon if I\u2019m going out in the evening,\u2019 he says cheerily. \u2018I feel very lucky.\u2019 Osborne also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying Britain under Labour will mimic France's course since it voted in socialist Francois Hollande as president . Osborne\u2019s tour of the West Country has been designed to target seats where the Tories are fighting the Lib Dems. At Hawkins Garage in St Austell, Cornwall, to promote the Government\u2019s apprenticeship scheme, the Chancellor was shown by 17-year-old trainee mechanic Dale Wilkes how to drain a car sump. Osborne\u2019s hand ended up drenched in oil. If he had been asked to do it in his \u2018hunkered down\u2019 phase he would have found it torture. Here, with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls, it wasn\u2019t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as Dale passed him a spanner. From St Austell it was back to\u00a0Somerset and Yeovil, where Osborne hopes the Tory candidate will unseat Lib Dem David Laws who was, until two weeks ago, a Coalition colleague. Osborne was such a fan of Laws that when the Coalition was formed in 2010, he made Laws his deputy, stating that he was \u2018put on earth to be Treasury Chief Secretary\u2019. \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t last long in that position!\u2019 hoots Osborne with a fiendish grin. Laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an MPs\u2019 expenses scandal which led to him being painfully \u2018outed\u2019 as gay. Osborne\u2019s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem who succeeded Laws as Osborne\u2019s Treasury deputy, claimed that an unnamed \u2018very senior Tory\u2019 told him: \u2018You take care of the workers, we\u2019ll take care of the bosses.\u2019 Was it Osborne who said it, as many suspected? \u2018No,\u2019 the Chancellor snaps. But if he has rescued the economy and Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are so useless, as he always claims, why aren\u2019t the Conservatives ahead in the polls? Is it time to press the panic button? \u2018The campaign is going as we wanted it to,\u2019 he insists. Really? \u2018Yes. We always thought it would be close.\u2019 Mr Osborne said he never 'personally felt low' about being booed at the Paralympics in 2012, but had to explain it to his children . But Miliband is proving more resilient than the Tories expected. \u2018Only because he\u2019s standing behind podiums in front of Labour supporters,\u2019 he mocks. Tory MPs claim that their party\u2019s campaign lacks passion and that Cameron\u2019s Australian election guru, Lynton Crosby, is too aggressive and too powerful. Osborne stands foursquare behind them: \u2018David Cameron leads this Election campaign from the front.\u2019 It provokes him into showing some passion of his own. \u2018I\u2019m not about to hand over the keys to No 11 to Ed Balls, saying, \u201cGo and wreck all the good work we\u2019ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country.\u201d Absolutely not!\u2019 The one U-turn Osborne has made during the last five years is moving his wife Frances (pictured) and their children to No 11 Downing Street, so he can be closer to them . He says that if Labour wins, Britain will become an economic basket case like France did after socialist Francois Hollande won power. \u2018France is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour, jobs go, debts pile up. People will say, \u201cMy God, Britain is going backward instead of forward.\u201d Osborne is in his stride now, spitting venom. \u2018All this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from Labour about standing up for\u00a0the many not the few\u2026 the people who suffer most when Labour governments screw up the economy are the poorest.\u2019 A measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month Cameron named Osborne as one of three potential successors \u2013 and no one laughed. So would he like to become PM? \u2018I\u2019m not a politician who spends my life thinking, \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d and \u201cWhat when\u2026?\u201d \u2019 Rot, he can be every bit as calculating as Labour\u2019s Machiavellian Peter Mandelson, we tease him. \u2018I\u2019m not rising to that!\u2019 he laughs. Osborne was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his Tatton constituency, combining politics with a family day out. He was accompanied by Frances, a successful author and daughter of former Tory Minister Lord David Howell, and Luke and Liberty. \u2018We\u2019re all really looking forward to the Election. The children are interested in it. My son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones,\u2019 he chuckles. \u2018Then The Voice came on TV and we switched over to that.\u2019 With that, Osborne takes another sip of his Somerset cider, aptly called Thatchers Gold. It slakes Osborne\u2019s thirst for now. But he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the Tories don\u2019t win Election gold on May 7.", "claim": "george osborne drinks a pint of somerset cider as he is interviewed. his demeanour

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement. But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home. In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business. And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo \u2013 which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses \u2013 has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors. Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s . At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire. At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat. Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale. 'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57. 'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.' He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business . The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss . He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world. 'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away \u2013 but it wasn't a problem. I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.' Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors. Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel. He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean. 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007. 'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.' The four-bedroom home is now on the market for \u00a3599,000. At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building . The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat \u2013 and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s. But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself. In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village. It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own \u2013 the very property that Branson would one day end up converting. Price: \u00a3599,000 . Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson; former Wesleyan chapel in the village where John Wesley gave his first sermon . At the time of his first sermon, Wesley was studying at Oxford University. The Jacobean pulpit in St James the Great bears a plaque commemorating the sermon, which is reputed to have lasted two-and-a-half hours. 'We were looking for a property in South Leigh as we had friends in the area,' says recently separated Rowan, 50 \u2013 a management consultant with two children, Jacob, 15, and Nancy, 13. 'We fell in love with the house the moment we saw it.' Rowan only found out Branson had been a previous owner on his second viewing. 'That undoubtedly increased our interest, especially when we realised what an excellent job he had done converting it into a home, without losing too many of its original features,' said Rowan. 'And the house ticked all the boxes for us. It has lots of space and is conveniently located for the A40, with good access to London.' At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, pictured is the kitchen . The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden . The building is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout it. Features that Branson added include pine banisters and large round windows offering views across surrounding countryside. The property has an en suite and family bathroom, and the master bedroom overlooks the back garden. A studio room could be used as an office or fifth bedroom. The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden. A kitchen and third reception room complete the accommodation. 'We have the benefit of open space, yet it is still cosy and warm due to a large woodburner in one of the reception rooms,' says Rowan. 'I'll definitely miss the place.' Rowan is moving to Witney so that his children can be closer to their schools and friends.", "claim": "sir richard branson converted the old chapel in shipton-on-cherwell, oxfordshire. he had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away. sir richard branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up virgin recording business. the virgin logo has been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors. at the manor, the first virgin albums were recorded and branson.", "cnndm_id": "bae8201fa542f26641a61429764b4aa9a1209c07", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement.", "But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home.", "In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business.", "And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo \u2013 which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses \u2013 has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors.", "Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s .", "At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire.", "At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat.", "Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale.", "'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57.", "'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.'", "He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business .", "The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss .", "He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world.", "'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away \u2013 but it wasn't a problem.", "I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.'", "Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors.", "Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel.", "He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean.", "'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007.", "'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.'", "The four-bedroom home is now on the market for \u00a3599,000.", "At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel .", "The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building .", "The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat \u2013 and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s.", "But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself.", "In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village.", "It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own \u2013 the very property that Branson would one day end up converting.", "Price: \u00a3599,000 .", "Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire .", "Bedrooms: Four .", "Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson;

When asked why, 43 per cent said they could not be bothered and 39 per cent said they did not think the value warranted the effort. Four in ten Britons have an average \u00a377 of unwanted good because they have not got round to returning it . A fifth (21 per cent) are too busy, believing that it takes nearly half an hour to return something each time, suggesting time is put ahead of hard earned cash. Confusing processes were also identified as a major deterrent to sending an item back for 22 per cent. The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer. Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items. Amongst the most commonly unreturned items were women's dresses, shoes and trousers, which occupied the top three spots. Then came women's shirts or blouses, women's jeans, electrical equipment, women's jackets, homeware, jewellery and women's underwear, according to the One Poll survey of 2,000 people. Most people say it is simply too inconvenient to return the item, or not worth the cost .

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "A Facebook post and a Craigslist ad worked together to solve the 34-year-old cold case murder of a teenage girl from Michigan who was found stabbed nine times in the woods in rural Louisiana. Carol Cole was 17 years old when she disappeared without a trace after running away from a juvenile detention center in Texas in October 1980. In January 1981, police in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, found a teenage girl stabbed nine times in the back and chest stashed under a pile of leaves in the woods out of a dirt road outside Shreveport. For 34 years, Carol's family searched in vain for the troubled teen. At the same time, detectives from Bossier Parish never stopped trying to identity the body they found mutilated in the woods. Coming together: The picture at left is the image used by Carol Cole's family on Craigslist posts across Texas and Louisiana. The image at right is a rendering of 'Bossier Doe' created for a Facebook page posted by detectives in an attempt to identify a body found in January 1981 . Carol Cole escaped from a Texas juvenile jail in October 1980 after moving from Michigan with her mother. Her remains have been found and identified after 34 years . Relieved: Carol Cole's sister, Jeanie Phelps of Kalamazoo, Michigan, (center) with Bossier Sheriff's Lt. Shannon Mack and Sgt. Dave Faulk . Now, social media has brought Carol's family and Louisiana detectives together. In February, DNA confirmed that the body in Louisiana matched missing Carol's DNA, the Detroit News\u00a0reports. New attention to the case has brought forward a potential suspect, as well. John Chesson, who is already in prison for an unrelated murder, is named as a person of interest in Carol's brutal death . Carol's sister Jeanie Phelps\u00a0and her friend posted Craigslist ads across Texas and Louisiana with pictures of the teen, hoping someone might recognize her. At the same time, Bossier Parish Lieutenant Shannon Mack crated a Facebook post for 'Bossier Doe' (Facebook doesn't allow Jane Doe page names). It included a digitally-rendered drawing of the victim based on her skeletal remains. Carol's family aznd Bossier detectives made a connection six days later when Bossier Parish 911 dispatcher Linda Erickson was trolling through Craigslist. Long road: Cole, from Michigan, was eventually found dead in Louisiana. She was last heard from in December 1980 and found dad a month later . These are the shoes that Carol was wearing when she was found dead. Police posted pictures of them in the hopes of jogging the memory of anyone who may have known her . Person of interest: John Chesson has been identified as a possible suspect by his own daughter. He's currently in prison for an unrelated murder . She had seen the Facebook page posted by detectives in her department. When she stumbled across Ms Phelps' Craigslist page, she realized that the rendering of Bossier Doe and picture of Carol looked remarkably similar. 'I can't explain it other than this child was meant to have an identity,' Ms Erikson tells the News. Perhaps even more remarkable, authorities in Bossier and Carol's family had crossed each other's paths some 30 years ago in a failed attempt to find the teen and identify the body. A coroner in the early 1980s examined the remains to see whether they matched Carol's description - but he said they weren't close enough for further investigation. Ms Phelps, Carol's sister, also considered the Bossier remains in the search for her missing sister - but says she must have glossed over them, WOOD-TV reports. All the new attention has also brought forward a potential suspect in Carol's murder. \u00a0Convicted murderer John Chesson's own daughter told the News that media coverage of Carol's case jogged her memories that the teen had been staying at their house in 1980 before she disappeared. Frances LeBlanc says that her father was a violent, abusive man. And he was also the one who claimed to have found Carol's body in the woods and alerted police. Detectives have not filed charges, but say they are investigating whether Chesson murdered the teenager nearly 35 years ago.

Three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen, leading to vast, winding tunnels . The subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of Earth. It lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress and the surrounding area, which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (TOK\u0130). The multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, according to a report in National Geographic. The find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement. A view of the underground city newly discovered in Turkey's Central Anatolian province of Nevsehir, which is famous for fairy chimney rock formations. The city was built from volcanic ash rock . The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scientists have yet to discover all its secret passages . Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.' The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material. The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks. The latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement. Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances. Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances. It had areas for sleeping, stables, wells, kitchens, ventilation shafts, tombs, communal rooms, bathrooms. Like Derinkuyu, the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders, but remains largely unexplored. But this city is far larger, with early estimates suggesting it could be around a third bigger than Derinkuyu. Geophysicists from Nev\u015fehir University recently conducted a systematic study of a 1.5 mile (4 km) area using geophysical resistivity and seismic tomography. The studies suggest the underground corridors may go as deep as 371ft (113 metres), but the exact size remains unknown.

In her Instagram post she called the Oscar-winning actress 'sexy' and noted that her husband of two years took a gander at her cleavage, writing: '#WhereAreThoseEyesWanderingReynolds #HelenMirrenIStheSexiestWomanAlive #WomanInGold.' Speaking to People, Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. 'You know, he makes a girl feel good,' she explained. 'Some guys don't.

Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush\u2019s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush\u2019s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was \u2018crazy\u2019 with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova\u2019s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest:\u00a0\u2018We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.\u2019 Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of \u00a373,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years. Mayka Marica Kukucova, pictured after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia . Ms Kukucova had given herself up in her home town which is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Spain . 'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than \u00a359,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy hailed the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of players after a determined 1-1 draw at his former club Wolves moved Town closer to securing a place in the SkyBet Championship play-offs. Despite Wolves bouncing back to take a point through Benik Afobe's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a Richard Stearman own goal had given Ipswich a first-half lead, Town's play-off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining. Former Wolves boss McCarthy was delighted with his side's determined display and he said: 'It was a good performance and a good point. It is very pleasing. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were denied three points as rivals Wolves fought back to draw 1-1 on Saturday . 'Wolves were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great, stubborn, belligerent, professional performance - all those horrible words people don't like in football but I do because you win games and win leagues by doing that. 'We are always hard to beat and hard to play against. 'The first thing I said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent, stubborn, hard working, tough, horrible bunch you have turned out to be and I love you and I am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team. It is lovely to have. 'A lot of those qualities are probably the reasons why we are where we are. 'It takes a lot of things to be in the top six and there will be teams below us who are all playing sexy football but we are winning games and we are in the top six and we still have a chance of being promoted. 'So to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it I laugh at them and think it is comical because I think what we do we do well and isn't that what having a job is all about?' Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal . McCarthy, who was sacked by Wolves in February 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club, insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to Molineux. He added: 'I think I am very much liked and respected by the Wolves fans and I love the club and the people here so I don't think I have got anything to prove and I always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back. 'But I have taken the point and I am happy with that.' Although they trailed at the break, Wolves needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when Afobe stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with Nouha Dicko carrying their greatest. McCarthy hails the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of Ipswich players . They could not find a second goal, though, and their play-off hopes are now hanging by a thread. However, coach Kenny Jackett insisted they will not be throwing in the towel. He said: 'It is out of our hands and now we will need to win our final two games and other teams will need to lose. But you don't know what will happen. So we need to make sure that we go again next week. 'It is a tough call, we understand that. We will have to see how the table looks but one way or another we have to put in a good performance and give it everything we have got next week at Wigan. Kenny Jackett is still hopeful his Wolves side can secure a Championship play-off spot despite the 1-1 draw . 'If the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there.' He added: 'We gave it everything against Ipswich. I thought that we showed a lot of spirit, effort and energy in the second half when we pushed Ipswich all the way. The attitude and tempo was there.' 'Ultimately it is a better point for Ipswich than it is for us. We needed to win and I felt that we built up very well in the second half. We got a goal back early on but couldn't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute Ipswich defence.

Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She\u2019s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Scroll down for video . She's back! Britt McHenry (left) has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she\u2019s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn\u2019t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I\u2019m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding:\u00a0'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026 with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports. When the bar shuts at 2am, the private towing company, Advanced Towing, within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot. The firm showed\u00a0magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to\u00a0suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry.

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.", "claim": "two cnn heroes are among the earthquake survivors. anuradha koirala has a rehabilitation center in kathmandu to 425 young women and girls. public has been warned not to use main water line due to cholera. she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster.", "cnndm_id": "dae2675302d92bdf0bbd6d35c3e473389f8bb5a1", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal.", "And they are struggling in the aftermath.", "Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls.", "While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12.", "The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry.", "\"We are suffering with rain, strong wind.", "The fear is not gone from us.", "It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year.", "The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera.", "Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food.", "Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster.", "\"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said.", "\"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse.", "Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything.", "...", "If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\"", "About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled.", "Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard.", "\"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said.", "\"Everything is broken in the hospice.\"", "Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged.", "\"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said.", "\"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it.", "I was not afraid that I was going to be killed.", "I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\"", "Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence.", "They are now living on the ground in a nearby field.", "\"Physically, we are not hurt.", "But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated.", "Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down.", "She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves.", "\"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said.", "\"We are really scared.\"", "They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says.", "But she is trying to stay positive.", "\"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?

The Cyclone statement added: \u2018If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.\u2019 Hearn countered the Cyclone statement, telling Sportsmail: \u2018We just want to get it done, it\u2019s so frustrating\u2026 I know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that\u2019s because it was getting nowhere.

The blue Audi pulls out from Whitchurch road, in Chester and accelerates into the side of the bus . It then collides into the bus as part of the \u00a31million 'crash for cash' scam that took place over three years . The elaborate fraud allowed passengers on the bus, who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam, to falsely claim from insurers . Smith, the managing director of Swift Accident Solutions, stage-managed the crashes around the Chester area over the three-year period, in a bid to create new claimants for his business. He then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than \u00a31million - to no win no fee lawyers. All of the bogus claims submitted by the Smith's company were for whiplash and 'soft tissue injuries,' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies. Instead, insurers were forced to rely on the individual claimants and usually settled out of court. John Smith (right), 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales is facing jail after stage-managing several collisions in a \u00a31m 'crash for cash' fraud; Luke McQuillan (left) was found guilty of\u00a0of conspiracy to commit fraud . Police uncovered Smith's plot after being alerted by First Direct insurance to the unusually high volume of claims. They also found more than 90 per cent\u00a0of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another. The majority were friends or relatives of the 12 defendants, the court was told. The court heard how Smith had introduced 177 new claimants to a lawyer for which he received \u00a3960 each time. Investigators later found that the bogus claims accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total gross income at Swift Accident Solutions during the period. Smith was convicted yesterday at Manchester Crown Court Smith of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, following a 41-day trial. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud. Four more people had already pleaded guilty to the charge, while two defendants were found not guilty.\u00a0Police believe more arrests will still be made over the scam. During the trial, the court was told how Smith masterminded the scam by finding drivers who were willing to carry out a fake crash. More than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another and were mainly said to be friends and relatives of the 12 defendants. Pictured: Richard Flynn (left) and Barry Cooper (right) were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud following the 41-day trial at Manchester Crown Court . The drivers would then pull out at low speed, using vehicles provided by Smith, and collide with the buses. The single and double decker buses had been chosen out of 'greed' because of the sheer number of claims that could be lodged, the court was told. Bus driver John Griffths told the court how he was caught up in one of the accidents while driving a park and ride bus towards Chester in June 2011. He told how he broke gently when he saw the Rover car pulling out of the side road, in a bid to prevent his standing passengers from being flung along the aisle. He added: 'I couldn't brake harshly because I had standing passengers, if I'd have done that they would have gone forward, so I had to go gently. The driver of the car said it was his fault, that his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator.' But he said one woman quickly reported that she 'wasn't feeling well'. He was also approached by three men, one of whom claimed he had hurt his leg on the bus steps, despite having no visible sign of injury. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud including Dean Brown, 42, (left) and Barry Cooper, 35 (right) When an ambulance was called to the scene, treatment was declined, he added. A passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the Rover driver, at a side junction, actually looking at the bus just before to the collision. Although there was a 'minimal jolt', a fellow passenger was overheard exclaiming 'oh my back', he said. Smith was also accused of making a false representation by not declaring two outstanding county court judgments when applying for a licence to operate his claims management business. After the case Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale from Chester CID said the force would continue to investigate the case. He said: 'This was an extremely complex investigation spanning nearly three years and involving a large number of defendants. 'It has been a challenging process for all officers involved and has required considerable professional skills in relation to the investigation and the subsequent prosecution. 'As part of our investigation conducted a significant number of interviews, to gather the required evidence to prove that Smith and his associates had stage these collisions for the sole purpose of financial gain. 'The crime that they committed was not a victimless crime, had all of the false claims created by Smith and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been over \u00a31 million, which would have been paid for by law abiding citizens through their car insurance policies.' Det Con Stephen Owens added: 'The Police have a duty to protect life, and although these collisions were all minor, they could have been much more serious. 'Yet despite the fact all of the collisions were minor, with minimal damage to both vehicles, they all resulted in multiple claims for personal injury claims, with the vast majority of these claims submitted via Smiths company.

'Through our investigations and the evidence we have gathered, we have been able to identify a \"passenger Network\" which shows that a large proportion of the claimants can be linked to each other. This network proves that over 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions are linked to each other. 'Although the trial against these defendants has now concluded, we will continue to investigate this case and further arrests are likely.'

{"filename": "test_chen18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was \u2018heavily geared\u2019 towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start \u2018shedding\u2019 jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could \u2018go stale\u2019 with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 \u2013 and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a \u2018job for life\u2019 meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly \u2018reskill\u2019 and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: \u2018The old model of training in youth and a \"career for life\" thereafter no longer applies\u2019. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master\u2019s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a \u2018lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks\u2019. Education:\u00a0A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification .

The spectacular isolated fort, one of three guarding the entrance to the Solent, just off the coast of the Isle of Wight, has been turned into a luxury impregnable haven complete with a rooftop hot tub, shops and even its own nightclub, thanks to a multi-million pound revamp. The unique hotel looks like could be a fortress of a James Bond villain and can sleep 44 guests with a capacity of 200 for parties and events. Scroll down for video . For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck for ocean views . The No Man's Fort has been transformed by AmaZing Venues to become a luxury hotel, and is set to open on April 23 . With four floors packed with a variety of entertaining facilities, it\u2019s a unique location that\u2019s sure to leave guests with unforgettable memories . The sea fort is located 2km out at sea, meaning guests have to make an exciting entrance by helicopter or by boat. On arrival at the ocean hotspot, guests can hit up the shops, restaurants, luxury spa, rooftop bar and firepit, cabaret bar, nightclub or LaZer Battle Arena. If water sports are more your style this is the perfect base for enjoying\u00a0RIB rides, jet biking, sea kayaking, or kite surfing. A spokesman for AmaZing Venues said: 'No Man's Fort is an inspiring private island that offers an unrivalled experience. 'It is three times the size of Spitbank Fort and boasts its own lighthouse with spectacular views across the Solent. 'You'd think being a mile offshore is unique enough, but we've crammed every possible space with unusual things to see and experience. Built between 1867 and 1880, No Man's Fort was one of several forts ordered by then-Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to fend off the French Navy. It needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. At the time it cost \u00a3462,500 to build, which with inflation would be equivalent to more than \u00a343million today. It was the first fort in England, and possibly Europe, to use hydraulic power to move the guns in horizontal and vertical planes for targeting and the first to be lighted throughout with electricity. The fort was in active use by the military up to 1957 - housing anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War - and became a scheduled ancient monument in 1967. A developer bought it in 1987 to convert it into a luxury residence but failed to find a millionaire buyer. Birmingham businessman Harmesh Pooni bought it to run as as a corporate hospitality venue but he ran into financial difficulties and had to close down. He eventually barricaded himself inside until he was removed. The fort eventually sold in 2009 for just \u00a3910,000. 'The potential of this magnificent sea fortress is only restrained by your imagination. 'A trip to the fort can be as relaxing or action-packed as you wish. 'For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck.' Described on the website as '75,000 sq ft of fun,' adventurers can unwind overlooking the spectacular rooftop views, whilst enjoying a BBQ, before retiring to one of the 23 luxury suites which cost \u00a3450 per night. Those who have the means to splash out on the best suite in the fort, the plush lighthouse facilities can cost \u00a31,150 a night during the summer. Bond villain haven! The modern fort has two helipad zones, as well as offering roof top BBQ facilities for an ocean-facing meal . Do not disturb! The fort boasts 23 luxury suites and can sleep 44 guests, with prices ranging from \u00a3450 per night . A room with a view! Not only does this hotel offer one of the most private hotel stays, but also incredible ocean views . The unusual destination boasts a colourful history and was even featured in the 1971 Dr Who episode, The Sea Devils, with Jon Pertwee. Built between 1867 and 1880, it was originally used to defend the coast against French invasion, and was used during both world wars to protect Portsmouth Harbour from attacks. In order to construct the impressive fort, huge blocks of granite were transported by barge to the site, and were lowered onto the seabed for its foundations. Luxury loo! The hotel has been renovated with many modern activities and facilities for guests to have a comfortable and memorable stay . Views above the atrium roof are spectacular, and guests can enjoy a meal on the roof overlooking the beautiful coast off the Isle of Wight . The thick 60ft-high concrete walls mean guests can rest easy knowing the fort can withstand any ocean waves crashing again its sides. While it would have cost about \u00a3462,500 to build when it was first created, inflation would equate to that figure being closer to \u00a343million today. AmaZing Venues forked out \u00a33million in first transforming sister venue, Spitbank Fort, which opened in 2012, with this venture being three times as big.

Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. \"If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,\" Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: \"Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion.\" \"Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza\" tweeted A\u10e6anda. \"Just mock them for their ignorance.\" Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. \"Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!\" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  \"Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business.\" Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. \"Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?\" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads \"bigots.\" Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. \"Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?\" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. \"Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses,\" said a tweet from Victor Nikki. \"What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob,\" tweeted Savannah. \"Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere.\" Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is \"to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith,\" according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. \"That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual,\" Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. \"You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be.\" Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

And forecasters warned that initial figures suggest that so far this month Britain has only seen 35 per cent of the average rainfall for April. The dry spell follows months of below-average rainfall and conditions are not expected to bring significant showers before May's arrival. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said: \u2018We are over halfway through the month but we've had around a third of the rainfall we get on average. \u2018Over the next week temperatures are going to stay above average for most parts of the country, with the high pressure lasting until the weekend.\u2019 Weather data for the year so far shows national rain fall has been significantly lower than average nearly every month.

Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from. Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June. Manchester City's tenacious, \u00a0creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea) At 36 years old, he is no spring chicken, but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side. Tremmel has played second fiddle to Michel Vorm and then Lukasz Fabianski during his four years at Swansea, but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the Swans beat Bradford in the Capital One Cup final two years ago. Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel, 36, is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - Glen Johnson (Liverpool) England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool, but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer. Johnson, who has 54 England caps, is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books. England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup looks set to leave Liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - Kolo Toure (Liverpool) Another regular at Liverpool who is still to extend his contract. Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November, but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club. Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool . Centre-back - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows, especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him. Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season. At 30, he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams. Holland's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa . Left-back - Luke Garbutt (Everton) Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal, but he is yet to put pen to paper. The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere. Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he's yet to commit . Right wing - James Milner (Manchester City) Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer, Milner has 15 years' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps. Milner is both tenacious and creative, either in the centre of midfield or out wide, and he is still a year off his 30th birthday. Milner has 15 years in top flight experience, 53 England caps and still isn't 30, so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Named Arsenal captain last summer, but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury. Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return. May be 33, but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist. Mikel Arteta hasn't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin . Central midfield - Tom Cleverley (Manchester United) Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer, Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal. 'I think I'm going to be his type of player,' he said. But alas, that did not prove to be the case. The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa, where he has played 30 times. He is not wanted back at United. Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international. Unwanted by Manchester United, Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley . Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez (Newcastle) Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month, but is no longer wanted by his club. Will be 32 in the summer, but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him. Testicular cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere, even if it isn't Newcastle . Striker - Danny Ings (Burnley) One of a number of young English strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for Burnley this season. Rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United and their neighbours City, as well as David Moyes' Real Sociedad. Manchester United and City are said to be interested in Burnley's dangerous striker Danny Ings . Striker - James Wilson (Manchester United) Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under Ryan Giggs against Hull.

After the royal couple\u2019s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo began working as a lookalike full-time. She said: 'I had so many calls I was doing four to five days a week, appearing at corporate events and doing shoots. 'It was really strange, people wanting a picture with me, but I got into it and really had fun.' Miss Bredo studies Kate\u2019s mannerisms as well as following her beauty regime. She said: 'I have regular trims to keep my hair looking good, every two months and curl the ends the same as Kate. 'Her signature look is a lot of black eyeliner so I get through that really quickly. 'I spend \u00a330 a month buying black eyeliner. My favourite brand is Bare Minerals. She has regular trims to keep her hair in good shape, spends \u00a330 a month on black eyeliner, has regular manicures and buys clothes that are distinctly 'Kate' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George last year, Miss Bredo (middle) has had plenty of shoots with tots and has even has to wear a baby bump . 'She also wears very harsh blusher and has natural nails so I give myself regular manicures.' Miss Bredo spends hours searching for the Duchess on the internet so she can keep up-to-date with her wardrobe. She said: 'If she\u2019s wearing something new, I\u2019ll try and find it but it\u2019s usually sold out instantly. 'I know what kind of clothes she\u2019ll wear now. 'When I\u2019m going clothes shopping I\u2019ll choose some things that I think are \"Kate.\" 'I picked up this black and white spotted dress and my mum didn't think it was something the Duchess of Cambridge would wear. 'Then I saw a picture of her when she was pregnant with George \u2013 it was the same one I\u2019d bought. 'I think she\u2019s copying me now.' Kate Middleton (pictured in London on 12 March) is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William any day now . Miss Bredo usually appears with a William lookalike and their after-work drinks get plenty of attention. She said: 'You can tell people are staring and some people take sneaky pictures of us. 'But a lot of people come up and ask to take a picture, it\u2019s funny we\u2019re just two friends having a drink. 'Even on my own I get lots of double takes \u2013 especially if I\u2019m in London.' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George, aged one, Miss Bredo has had plenty of shoots with tots.

Detectives have issued a photo of a brown haired, Caucasian male wearing a black top who they want to speak to after  a fire was started at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2.15am on  April 1. Victoria Police said: 'Detectives have released a FACE image of a man that may be able to assist with their enquiries.' Dandenong Crime Investigation Unit detectives are yet to determine the exact cause of the fire which is being treated as suspicious. The Dandenong fire was one of a string of suspected arson attacks on three Melbourne Catholic churches with links to paedophile priests. The church is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased convicted paedophile Father Kevin O'Donnell. Police have released an image of a bearded young man they want to speak to in relation to a suspected arson attack on a Catholic church in Melbourne . Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious . Police are investigating whether the blaze is connected to two separate suspicious blazes that were lit two days before at St James Catholic Church in Brighton and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda, where paedophile priest Ronald Pickering served as minister. St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong\u00a0is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased Father Kevin O'Donnell . On April 1, it took firefighters 90 minutes to extinguish blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street in Dandenong. Father O'Donnell - who was reportedly known by police as the 'two-a-day man' - was jailed for 15 months in 1995 after he admitted to abusing\u00a010 boys and two girls. He is believed to have committed hundreds of sexual assaults against  young girls and boys over the 50 years that he worked in Victorian Catholic churches, before he retired in 1992. He died in 1997. At the Dandenong church in 1958 Father O'Donnell allegedly molested a 15-year-old boy in the presbytery and went on to sexually abuse his brother, sister and friends,\u00a0The Age reported. He presided over the church from 1958 to 1986, before moving onto Oakleigh. On March 30,\u00a0heritage-listed St James Catholic Church in Brighton was mostly destroyed by fire and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda was found with a small amount fire damage to a door. Bishop Peter Elliott told 3AW Catholic churches would be increasing their security, and said he did not believe the fires were lit by sex abuse victims. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths said she was 'quite elated' when she heard the 124-year-old James Catholic church  had been destroyed by fire. Firefighters extinguished blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street . The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church's former parishioners she found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the  building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it was left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by 'tragedy and complicated feelings' and described it as being known locally as 'the haunted house on the hill'. 'We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,' she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D'Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D'Brass said: 'Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. 'I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: 'I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. 'He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. 'One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.' Many of the church's former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. 'MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: 'You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.' 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos.\u00a0And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: 'Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.' Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails. The pipe organ by Alfred Fuller of Kew, placed centrally in the rear gallery, is a rare example of his work'.

Speaking to Sportsmail from Sydney, Cheika repeatedly name-checked a certain knight of the realm and columnist of this newspaper, among the voices arguing that the green-and-gold pack will be smashed into submission. \u2018It has been pretty well reported here that Clive Woodward and others have said that England are going to take us apart in the forwards,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been hearing. I understand that they will have a lot of confidence in their forwards to take us on, but I think you discount the English backs at your peril, because they have some very powerful runners. In Ben Youngs, Care and Wigglesworth, they have three half-backs who will challenge the line every time. \u2018Joseph looks like a nice player and they\u2019ve got some good options in midfield now. Tuilagi will come back into it, they have Barritt too and big Sam (Burgess) might even get a run soon enough, as he grows into the game. Ford has done well for England at 10, they\u2019ve got fast wingers and I\u2019m a big fan of Mike Brown at full-back. There are a variety of threats that we will have to deal with.\u2019 Cheika\u2019s admiration for England\u2019s attacking runners behind the scrum is part of the former Leinster coach\u2019s overall assertion that the European nations are just as adept at playing an open game as their southern rivals, when conditions allow. But his repeated references to the pre-tournament dismissal of his pack suggest that there will be a strong emphasis on the set piece in particular during the World Cup countdown over the summer. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau (left) is set to feature for the Wallabies at the World Cup . \u2018Commentators in the UK are saying we won\u2019t be able to match it with England and Wales in the forwards,\u2019 he reiterated. \u2018They\u2019re saying that it\u2019s a shame to waste the talent in our backs. There\u2019s been a fair bit of that coming out, but we\u2019re working hard to make up ground in that area. \u2018Clive Woodward \u2013 who is not just your average spectator \u2013 says we won\u2019t be able to compete with the English scrum. For us, it\u2019s about having a clear philosophy about how we want to do it then practising a lot. We will aim to be at our best in every single scrum.\u2019 According to Cheika, the epic final day of this year\u2019s Six Nations \u2013 truly \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 \u2013 gave a vivid demonstration to viewers Down Under about the threat to the Wallabies from England and Wales. \u2018Both those sides are shaping up well,\u2019 he said. \u2018England will be on home soil and the Welsh will be much closer to home than we will be. I\u2019m sure they will be fancying their chances against us. Most people are looking at us as the ones who will be in the most trouble, but we will relish it and enjoy it. \u2018England and Wales will be feeling good about themselves after the Six Nations. The performance by Wales against Italy in their final game was incredible. I was watching it until it was 13-12 and it was the wee small hours here so I went to bed. When I woke up, they had won by 50! When they needed to, they were able to do that and that is very confidence-building.\u2019 As a long-standing fan of rugby league, Cheika is well aware of Sam Burgess\u2019s potential to make a major impact in his new code, once he has come through the transition phase. He is preparing for the Bath player to be unleashed against Australia; a country where he is revered in light of his title-winning exploits for the Rabbitohs in Sydney. Cheika has cited Ben Youngs (left) and Danny Care as dangerous No 9's who challenge the advantage line . Jonathan Joseph (second left) was superb for Stuart Lancaster's side throughout the RBS 6 Nations . \u2018I believe that he will be picked and that England will use him as a weapon off the bench with 10 or 15 minutes to go,\u2019 he said. \u2018He is a class footballer \u2013 a quality player and athlete. He\u2019s aggressive too, which he showed with the way he played in the rugby league Grand Final here last year. \u2018You would have him involved just for his mental approach and the way he takes the game on. There are going to be some tough calls, but just the fact that he is in the reckoning at all \u2013 even though he\u2019s only been in union a few months and had never played it before \u2013 is positive for him.\u2019 In contrast to his Kiwi counterpart, Steve Hansen, who is concerned that rugby is becoming boring, Cheika is expecting an \u2018awesome\u2019 World Cup with an emphasis on try-scoring, thanks in part to the improved pitches at leading grounds here such as Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium. \u2018It is like playing on a carpet,\u2019 he said. \u2018It makes teams a lot more confident to play positive footy.\u2019 Australia should be able to play positively, with their backline enhanced by the presence of Giteau \u2013 who had been in Test exile since moving to Toulon in 2011. Cheika confirmed yesterday that he met the 32-year-old recently, prior to the announcement of the ARU\u2019s historic policy change and believes that he can add utility value to the Wallaby squad. \u2018As far as I know, Matt Giteau has played No 9 there, on the odd occasion,\u2019 he said. \u2018His strength is at No 10 and No 12 obviously.\u2019 There will be reinforcements up front too, with veteran flanker George Smith another exile now back on the radar. He could find himself competing against a fit and revitalised David Pocock, and Michael Hooper \u2013 vying with hooker Stephen Moore for the captaincy \u2013 for the openside berth. With such pedigree in just one position, Australia\u2019s pack cannot be written off lightly. Cheika will use the jibes from afar to make sure his side are ready for the \u2018Pool of Death\u2019.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Despite countless campaigns, protests and marches, the notion of blaming a victim for their rape remains shockingly high. The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 0, "document": "Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians. The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\". It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President. 'We thought it was going to happen this year. I feel like we\u2019re close \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction. ' Scroll down for video . Kim and Khloe Kardashian laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame during their April 10 visit. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend, Kim Kardashian wrote in an op-ed, 'I would like President Obama to use the word \u201cgenocide.\u201d It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President' Tricky language: President Barack Obama sent an administration official to Armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim and Khloe walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial. They were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Khloe's  Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use last week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff also said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kardashian, who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins\u00a0Kara and Kourtni\u00a0Kardashian, said, 'Now is the time to speak out, and every little bit helps' 'I will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was,' the reality television star said, encouraging Turkey to label the killings as a genocide. 'It\u2019s not the fault of the people who live there now, ' she noted, and 'I think if they recognize it and acknowledge it, everyone can move on. 'I believe in moving on and looking toward a brighter future, but you can\u2019t move on unless you acknowledge the past. To not do so is an act of disrespect.' Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . Kardashian recalled in the op-ed that her family tree would have ended if her grandparents hadn't left Armenia for Los Angeles the year before the armed conflict. 'There are so many people who lost their families, and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking\u2014they should never be forgotten,' she wrote. 'The whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. A million-and-a-half people were brutally massacred, and a country can just pretend like it never happened? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.' While in Armenia, Kardashian and her family visited the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame that honors those countryman who were killed in 1915. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the flame. Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a\u00a0blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it. 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip to her ancestors' homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Khloe also kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Friday  the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters, beating its goal of 200,000 names. Google did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle, however. The White House said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' It announced at the same time that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew would attend a ceremony in Armenia on Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name this year to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed.", "claim": "kim kardashian has launched an outspoken president obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' he said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using word. kardashian has used her celebrity since 2011 to bring awareness to genocide. obama sent an administration official to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre. kim and khloe kardashian laid flowers at dzidzernagapert armenian genocide monument. historians estimate that 1.5 million armenians were killed by ottoman turks during world war i.. kardashian:' i would like president obama to use the word genocide", "cnndm_id": "12670e6af0ccf95cf8de50f651f0fded33d419b0", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians.", "The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office.", "Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide.", "Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\".", "It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President.", "'We thought it was going to happen this year.", "I feel like we\u2019re close \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.

'There was never much tension, only when people in the north would defect near that coast or security was ramped up after a skirmish or incident between the two countries.' The beaches, often filled with foreigners and day-trippers from the capital Seoul, features an 'overlapping' of military installations along the coast as it nears the border with the north, he said.

Also watching proceedings was royal fan Terry Hut, 79, who, in his Union flag suit, umbrella hat and sunglasses, provided the grey London street with a bright splash of colour. Mr Hut, who came prepared with Prince and Princess balloons, is a veteran of several royal births and spent 12 days camping outside the Lindo Wing ahead of Prince George's birth. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Margaret Tyler, 71, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than \u00a310,000. Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a \u00a31,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Memorabilia: Mrs Tyler, who has a royal collection worth \u00a310,000, came prepared with a Kate figurine . Cheerful: Despite their long wait, the group all appeared to be in good spirits . Ready for action: Mr Hut and Mr Loughrey both came prepared with balloons and signs . Serious business: While the royal fans sang, the police conducted a search of the area . Like Mr Loughery and Mr Hut, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive. 'I was there for six days,' she told a recent episode of BBC2 show Collectaholics. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting. I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' The Duchess of Cambridge, who is currently at Kensington Palace, is expected to give birth within days and is due on the 25th April. Today, Kensington Palace announced that her husband Prince William had completed his Air Ambulance training early, freeing him up to be with his wife and avoiding a two-hour hospital dash from Norfolk.

With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf.

Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland \u2013 specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland\u2019s largest glacier, Vatnajokull.

Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race .

In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time .

'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe\u2019s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus.

It marks the end of a six-year case, after the teenagers first reported their ordeal to officials at Clatskanie Middle School in Oregon - only to be told to 'suck it up'. Josi Harrison, Laura Lefebvre, and Hailey Walden were all in eighth grade when they claim their high school-age boyfriends lured them into sending nude pictures to their phones. Ordeal: Laura Lefebvre (left) and Josi Harrison (right) are two of three girls who have won a civil claim against their school district for failing to support them after being bullied into sending naked pictures to boyfriends . Traumatic: Hailey Walden, now a straight-A student, left Clatskanie Middle School to escape the harrowing experience after the principal and local police chief said she would be charged for the distribution of photos . After sending one, they were blackmailed into sending more. However, when they sought help from the principal and Clatskanie District police chief, they were told they would be charged with creating and distributing child pornography. On Thursday, two years after filing a civil suit against Clatskanie School District, a judge has ordered that each girl receive $75,000 in damages. All three girls have subsequently moved to new schools. Speaking in December 2013, Hailey Walden told\u00a0KATU: 'We had grown up with each other and he was always the popular cool guy that everyone wanted to date. I was 13, I didn't know. I thought that if I sent him the picture he would think I'm pretty and love me.' In total, she sent him 30 pictures, which then swept the school. However, her mother Billi Leinonen told the station, principal Jeff Baughman and police chief Marvin Hoover 'chuckled' when they brought the case to them. Hoover, she says, started reading Hailey her Miranda rights and said she would be charged. Though no charges were filed against Hailey, she claims the meeting exacerbated her trauma. On Thursday Clatskanie School District, which encapsulates CMHS, was ordered to pay $225,000 to the girls . Josi Harrison and Laura Lefebvre reported similar conflicts with school officials. Along with Hailey, they filed a $2.5 million federal suit against the district in 2013. The judge ordered a reduced payment on the grounds that the school has taken commendable steps to ensure the situation is not repeated. An attorney for one of the girls, Amber Lunsford, told Oregon Live: 'This suit was never about the money. It was about effecting change.' She added: 'Each of the girls accomplished what they wanted.' Reacting to the settlement on Thursday, Josi told\u00a0Fox 12 Oregon: 'I feel like it made me have to fight battles I shouldn\u2019t have to fight, especially at such a young age, but I feel it made me stronger.'

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 0, "document": "We are well versed in the dangers of using sunbeds, with skin cancer preying on the minds of all who expose their skin to the UV rays. But experts have warned the disease is not the only health danger associated with the pursuit of an artificial year-round tan. Those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes. Dermatologist\u00a0Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes . Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up. Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns the virus, and other bacteria, can survive on tanning beds, despite the heat. 'In my practice, I've seen acquired bacterial infections, warts, and herpes infections from tanning beds,' she told Yahoo. She said staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause skin infections, faecal bacteria, the herpes virus and the wart-causing human papillomavirus are all able to withstand the heat of a sunbed to survive. Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down. The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive. When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses. It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware. 'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned. 'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.' Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system. Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users .

During the drunken attack, which was caught on CCTV, Scots Guard Shaun Smith, 25, can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim\u2019s head. His fellow soldier, Welsh Guard Jason Collins, 22, rained blows with his fists on to the man\u2019s body. Scroll down for video . CCTV cameras captured the horrifying attack last April in which soldiers Shaun Smith (left, in black jeans) and Jason Collins (right, bending over), kicked and punched two men repeatedly near their barracks . Collins, 22, (right) has been stationed at Buckingham Palace since the attack. Smith (left), was described as an 'angel' in court by his officer . The soldiers were expected to be jailed for the \u2018deeply unpleasant and inexcusable\u2019 assault. But yesterday a judge at Teesside Crown Court made what even he admitted was an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 decision to let the men walk free. Judge James Hill, QC, said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them. \u2018I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope, as your commanding officers have expressed, that the Army feels able to keep you.\u2019 The furious victim James Wormald \u2013 who was left with the imprint of Smith\u2019s shoe on his forehead \u2013 said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened. \u2018There was absolutely no reason for the attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong. With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck, Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them. A judge rejected their version of events, saying the man seen in the footage (above) posed 'no threat' when they were beating him . \u2018I don\u2019t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries, the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it.\u2019 Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm. Smith was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work. Collins was given a 12-month community order, and both men were each told to pay \u00a31,000 compensation. The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service's sentencing guidelines. With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each, the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years. Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as 'exceptional'. In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised. Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended, while Collins received a 12-month community order. The pair launched the vicious attack after a night\u2019s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April. They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots. They encountered local men Mr Wormald, 25, and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words. Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them \u2013 a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald, a chef. The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald. Their victim runs across a road, trips and falls. Smith, who has a hood covering his face, can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim\u2019s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald\u2019s body. The pair then ran off and hid in a stream, but were caught by the police. Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face. Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James\u2019s Palace since the incident. He is likely to keep his job. Scots Guard Smith was also of previous good character.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will \"fix\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful. RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves. A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real \"crossroads of America.\" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work.", "claim": "indiana's controversial religious law has been in hot water lately. the state will fix the religious freedom act, or rfra. promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion serves no one. pence is making the right call.", "cnndm_id": "3ad0320476e8dda3a00604efdcf766e91766c815", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately.", "After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 0, "document": "Sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others, a recent study claimed . The implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding, it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders. This is because the genes that make up the people who we are, and the environments in which we are raised cannot be considered independently of each other. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right)\u00a0raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . The research analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. It found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population. In seeking to explain this connection, the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors. This can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together. On the other hand, their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases, with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members. Genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation (46 per cent) than for adult rape (19 per cent). While the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending, it cannot of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved. Dr Mairi Levitt says that\u00a0genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . Putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents. Of course genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment. As can be seen from the percentages above, the largest proportion of cases involved a large, rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour. You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in V\u00e4stmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of saliva from which the researchers extracted DNA. One of the genes examined was Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). This gene is a key enzyme which breaks down and releases energy in brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. The transmitter be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness . 'About 25 per cent of Caucasian men carry the less active variant of MAOA,' explained Professor Sheilagh Hodgins, a researcher at the University of Montreal. 'Among them, those who experience physical abuse in childhood are more likely than those who are not abused to display serious anti-social behaviour from childhood through adulthood.' Separating  nature and nurture may be useful as a model but does not really make sense because research has demonstrated that gene development is affected by the environment. Any report of genes influencing behaviour tends to polarise opinion. Some may welcome the science and see this as confirmation that sex offenders are biologically different from other people and could perhaps be prevented from offending. Others will be concerned about the stigmatisation of family members defined as 'at risk', but still unlikely to offend themselves. Only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at-risk families would mainly target the innocent. So what then might this mean in practical terms? The discovery could perhaps one day lead to the identification of specific genotypes but could or should this affect the way we deal with sex offenders? A genotype has already been identified that increases the risk of violent behaviour in specific environments. Dubbed the 'criminal' or 'warrior' gene, it has in some cases even been used successfully by defence teams in mitigation pleas to avoid the death penalty in the US, or reduce the length of sentences in the US and Italy. It might be thought odd that a convicted murderer, who is at increased risk of offending and therefore presumably more dangerous to the public in the future, would be treated more leniently. Sex offenders, particularly where children are involved, are probably even more stigmatised than other violent criminals so perhaps a genetic defence would not work in their favour. What is clear is that finding genetic influences on behaviour does not affect legal responsibility. It is recognised that there are many genetic, biological and environmental factors that influence behaviour, and it may be harder for all sorts of reasons for some people to refrain from criminal acts than others. Any research that helps us to understand problem behaviours is to be welcomed, but the headline figure \u2013 a genetic link in 40 per cent of cases \u2013 does not tell us that sex offenders 'can't help it' or are different from 'normal' people.

'That body is right back!' one Instagram user posted, while another added: 'I. Just. Don't. Understand. [sic]' Maggie thanked her commenters for being 'very kind' before noting that she takes great care over which images she chooses to share on her account, saying: \u2018I post carefully!\u2019 But one fan insisted on giving the model credit for getting her amazing body back into such great shape so quickly, writing: '@maggierizer there's not enough careful in the world to make me look like this even though I have ONE kid and she's almost two. You are killing it! [sic]' And Maggie has been working hard. Two weeks before her family vacation she shared a picture of herself on a Pilates reformer. 'Can't be a slacker forever I guess,' she captioned the photo of herself working up a sweat. Happy family: Maggie posed next to her husband\u00a0Alex Mehran to celebrate their newborn's 'first trip to the beach' Date night: Maggie and Alex were pictured enjoying a romantic dinner later that night . Maggie and Alex, who also have a three-year-old son named Zander, are spending time with their family, including their newborn at an unidentified tropical destination. Another Instagram snapshot, which was also posted yesterday, shows Maggie sporting patterned shorts and a pink tank as she poses next to Alex, who is holding their baby girl. 'Cecilia's first trip to the beach!' she wrote. Later that night, Maggie shared a picture of her and her husband enjoying wine and a glass of something bubbly during a romantic 'island' dinner. Maggie, who announced Cecilia's arrival into the world with a precious Instagram photo on February 9, continues to chronicle her children's adventures and their precious family moments on the social media site. Getting toned: Two weeks before her beach vacation, Maggie shared this photo of herself working out on a Pilates reformer . Pretty in pink: Maggie and Cecilia donned matching pastel outfits for Easter . All bump: Maggie showed off her growing belly with a selfie she took in January . Maggie rarely models but remains in demand, despite having moved to San Francisco for her husband's work. She was last seen on the catwalk in September 2014 at Michael Kors' New York Fashion Week show. Though her pregnancy was not public knowledge at the time, she would have been four months' pregnant - a point at which most expectant women start to show a small bump. Maggie, who originally hails from New York State, was one of the world's most popular models in the late Nineties and early 2000s. She stopped modeling in 2004 after it emerged that her stepfather, John Breen, who had been handling her finances, gambled away her entire fortune. Her professional earnings alone were estimated to be over $7million, though she also lost inheritance left by her biological father, Kevin Rizer, after his death from AIDS when she was 14. Since the loss of her father - her parents divorced when she was a baby when Kevin announced that he was gay - the model has been a staunch AIDS awareness activist.", "claim": "online commenters couldn't help but note how fit maggie looks. she posed with her two-year-old son quinnlann clancy for a sweet snapshot. just nine weeks after she gave birth to her daughter cecilia. the 37-year-old posted a photo of her third child and first daughter on february 9. maggie rizer only gave birth to daughter cecilia kathryn nine weeks ago.", "cnndm_id": "44c79b2a86076c9d3ff9a363c10e7478868ea8b7", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Supermodel Maggie Rizer only gave birth to her daughter Cecilia Kathryn nine weeks ago, but the mother-of-three is already back to her trim and toned self.", "The 37-year-old fashion veteran sported a tiny string bikini as she posed with her two-year-old son Quinnlann Clancy for a sweet snapshot, which she shared Monday on her Instagram account.", "'Boogie boarding with my baby,' she captioned the image.", "And online commenters couldn't help but note how fit Maggie looks only a few months after she and her husband\u00a0Alex Mehran welcomed their first daughter into the world.", "Beach body:", "Supermodel Maggie Rizer donned a string bikini while playing with her two-year-old son Quinnlyn Clancy on the beach - just nine weeks after she gave birth to her daughter Cecilia Kathryn .", "Bundle of joy:", "The 37-year-old shared this precious baby photo to announce the birth of her third child and first daughter on February 9 .", "'That body is right back!' one Instagram user posted, while another added: 'I.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "There were scenes of jubilation in the Dutch city of Dordrecht today, as flag-waving locals turned out to welcome King Willem-Alexander and his glamorous wife Maxima today. The visit, which kicked off with a pageant aboard a flotilla of boats on the local canal, was part of Willem-Alexander's 48th birthday celebrations. Koningsdag - or King's Day - is a public holiday in the Netherlands and is traditionally marked with a royal procession either in the capital Amsterdam or in one of the country's major cities. Happy family: The Dutch royals celebrated King Willem-Alexander's birthday in Dordrecht . Warm welcome: The Dutch royal couple were all smiles as they meet well-wishers in the trading city . Today, it was the turn of Dordrecht, a city in the south-west of the country, which was once a major trading port, as well as a military hub. Signs of its martial past were thin on the ground today, however, with the streets filled with a sea of joyful humanity, most of whom cheered and waved as the royals floated past. Taking centre stage was Argentina-born Queen Maxima, who opted for a typically eye-catching ensemble of a raspberry pink coat and hat enlivened with a pair of chunky crystal earrings. Also aboard the royal barge, the Dordtevaar, were the couple's three daughters:\u00a0Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange, 11, Princess Alexia, nine, and Princess Ariane, eight. Willem-Alexander's brother Prince Constantijn, 45, was also aboard, as was his 48-year-old wife, Princess Laurentien, who opted for a tailored dress in patriotic bright orange. Is that it? Eldest daughter Princess Catharina-Amalia, 11, cuddles up to her mother during the event . Round of applause: The Queen and the princesses join in with a round of applause for Willem-Alexander . Big arrival: The couple and their three daughters travelled through the city by barge . Family affair: \u00a0The couple was joined by Prince\u00a0Constantijn and his wife Laurentien who wore bright orange . Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in her summery raspberry pink get-up . Matching: The Dutch queen completed her look with a slick of bright pink lipstick and chunky earrings . All smiles: The 43-year-old appeared to be enjoying the occasion and smiled brightly throughout . Echoing their parents and uncle, all three girls smiled and waved at the crowds, most of whom seemed to be enjoying the bright spring sunshine while watching the procession go past. Others used the royal day off to make some extra money, with one enterprising soul setting up a stand that offered selfies with cardboard versions of the Dutch royals for \u20ac1 apiece. Koningsdag is a long-standing Dutch tradition that began in 1890 with Queen Wilhelmina who celebrated her birthday on the 31st August. When her daughter Juliana became Queen, the date was moved to the 30th April - a tradition maintained by her daughter Beatrix, even though her real birthday is the 31st January. Since April 2013, when Willem-Alexander took the throne following his mother's abdication, the holiday has taken place his birthday, the 27th April. The celebrations, which kick off the night before with King's Parties, also include vrijmarkts - flea markets - in most towns and mass consumption of a delicious orange pastry called the tompouce.

Winning the sweepstake was nice but three points was the main thing.\u2019 Leicester have appeared doomed to relegation for months, cemented to the bottom of the table since November. Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival . Vardy celebrates in front of the travelling away fans after hitting the winner against West Bromwich Albion . Vardy struck past West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill during the closing stages of the clash on Saturday . West Brom (4-4-2): Myhill 5.5; Dawson 5, McAuley 5, Lescott 5.5, Brunt 6; Gardner 6.5 (Olsson 73, 5), Yacob 6, Fletcher 7, Morrison 6.5 (Sessegnon 85); Ideye 5 (Anichebe 60, 5), Berahino 5.

But two successive wins give genuine hope of survival with seven games to play, five at home. Vardy struck a confident tone. Survival is, after all, in Leicester\u2019s hands. \u2018We\u2019ve all been running ourselves in the ground and not getting the points we deserve,\u2019 said Vardy. \u2018We\u2019ve not played bad in any game really. This just shows what we are capable of. \u2018We still want to be in this Premier League next year. We feel like we belong here. We\u2019ve never been battered and always given a good account of ourselves.\u2019 Leicester manager Nigel Pearson deserves credit for altering his team at half-time when 2-1 down to goals from Darren Fletcher and Craig Gardner. Leicester switched to a 3-5-2 formation and flooded men forwards in a bid to add to David Nugent\u2019s strike.

Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education.

However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects \u2013 real explosions rather than computer-generated ones.

There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue.

Chaos: An attempt at the world's biggest Easter egg hunt in Sacramento became shambolic on Sunday . Mayhem: Children as young as two were pushed to the ground as adults invaded the children-only event . 'There was no organization at all, they all trampled each other.

Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video . Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday . But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday . Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday . Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day . The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998.

Amedy Coulibaly stormed into the Hyper Cacher Jewish store, killing four and taking others captive before being shot dead in a hail of gunfire by French special forces. The heavily televised events in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Patrick Klugman, a lawyer representing the six survivors, said images broadcast from Hyper Cacher on January 9 'lacked the most basic precautions' and endangered those still alive inside. Scroll down for video . Police storm the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket, killing an Islamist terrorist in hail of gunfire. Six hostages who hid in a  freezer during the Islamist attacks have sued French media for broadcasting their location live . Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly slaughtered customers during the siege at the Hyper Cacher store. Lawyers claim French media endangered the lives of hostages hiding a freezer by revealing their location live on air . He singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV which revealed live on air that the group - including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby - was hiding  in the freezer. They had been taken to the cold room by one of the supermarket's employees. 'The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime,' Mr Klugman told AFP Thursday, roundly criticising coverage by other outlets of the movements by security forces during the standoff. The lives of those hiding 'could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting,' Klugman said. He added that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists. The lawsuit charges media  with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a \u20ac15,000 (\u00a311,000) fine. Extraordinary pictures emerged in the days after the siege showing the hostage huddled together for warmth amid cardboard boxes of food inside the freezer. Defying terror: Hyper Cacher reopened last month with a vow to 'show that life is stronger than barbarity' One woman is seen cradling her child, while in another image a hostage sends a text message to a loved one. Hearing shots, shoppers at the back of the store fled downstairs to the storeroom where they huddled together in temperatures of -3C (27F). Fearing they would not escape alive, they made what they believed would be their last calls to family to tell them they loved them.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans. Their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs. Over half, 54 per cent, also confessed they did not know that Lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites, affects their pets as well as themselves. Knowledge about Lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives. In extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases - such as Lyme disease - to humans . At the other extreme, symptoms may be so mild that someone who's been bitten by an infected tick may experience only flu-like symptoms. Ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans. Areas of undergrowth (including parks and gardens - as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife. It's why most people are bitten below the waist. With the forecast of increasingly damp winters and hotter summers - ideal conditions for the ticks to thrive - as well as growth in deer numbers, the concern is that the incidence of Lyme disease will rise further. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of Europe and North America. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease which can infect humans . Many people with early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around 3 to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans. Some people with Lyme disease also experience flu-like symptoms in the early stages, such as tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, joint pain,headaches, a high temperature (fever), chills and neck stiffness. More serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on. These can include: . Some of these problems will get better slowly with treatment, although they can persist if treatment is started late. A few people with Lyme disease go on to develop long-term symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. This is known as post-infectious Lyme disease. Source: NHS Choices . The increase in incidence of illnesses such as Lyme is 'a serious' cause for concern and 'ticks will become a very serious public health issue in the UK as a result of climate change', claims Julie Barratt, the director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health. She thinks we need to take a similar approach to avoiding tick-borne disease as we do to sun exposure - covering up and using insect repellent as we would sunscreen. This means taking precautions 'in the great outdoors, whether you're camping, walking in the countryside or in your back garden', she says. Concerned vets across the UK are now urging people to get their dogs checked out for the pests. Any ticks collected by vet practices will be sent to a team of scientists who will examine them for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Professor Richard Wall, from the University of Bristol, will be part of a team studying the ticks, and says their numbers have soared in the last 10 years. He said: 'Current evidence suggests that many tick-borne diseases in northern Europe are increasing in prevalence as a result of factors.' He explained this is due to changes in their habitat, increasing pet travel and climate change. He added: 'Warmer and wetter winters and milder wetter summers, in particular, may allow the normal highly seasonal pattern of tick activity to be extended, giving more continuous periods of exposure. 'In Great Britain the distribution of ticks is estimated to have expanded in the last 10 years by 17 per cent and the abundance of ticks to have increased at 73 per cent of locations surveyed.' Many people do not realise it is possible to catch Lyme disease in Britain. Joanne Drayson, from Guildford, who contracted the illness after being bitten by an infected tick while walking her dog, did not know it was possible to catch it in the UK. She said: 'I was aware of the disease but always thought it was something that was unique to the United States. 'After a long course of antibiotics, I gradually recovered my health. I still enjoy walking in the woods but now I go more prepared. 'It is important to cover up, tuck your trousers in your socks, have long sleeves and when you leave the woodland or countryside to always check for any ticks.' Public Health England estimates the number of new Lyme disease cases each year at around 3,000, while charities say the figure is closer to 15,000. In spite of this, the majority of people are still unaware that the potentially debilitating condition also affects dogs. Lyme disease is caused by a bite from an infected tick. Dogs can become bitten during walks in wooded areas or parkland in both urban and rural areas. Symptoms in dogs include lameness, lethargy and fever, which, if left untreated, can lead to more serious conditions such as kidney disease and heart failure. Many cases of Lyme disease are likely to go unnoticed by owners as they are only detected by a thorough examination. Throughout spring and early summer when ticks are most actives, vets taking part in The Big Tick Project, will be giving dogs visiting their practice a tick check. Ticks collected will be sent off for scientific analysis where they will be examined for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The Big Tick Project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham who wants to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with Lyme disease . The project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham and aims to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with the tick-borne disease. He said: 'Research suggests that ticks are a growing problem whether that's urban parkland to woodland and open country. 'Living as I do in the New Forest where ticks can be a problem and present a real threat to my dogs, this project is close to my heart and could be important in advancing both for canine and human health. 'I know people who have contracted the disease and I cannot begin to imagine how I would feel if my dogs were to catch it too. 'While I find ticks interesting creatures, I don't want them on my dogs, in my house or on me.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club. The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening \u00a3800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . \u2022 Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . \u2022 The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . \u2022 Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . \u2022 The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . \u2022 Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . \u2022 The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres \u2013 on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for \u00a380m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

The pair had been drinking at the pub before she returned to her home in Gwernaffield near Mold, Flintshire, North Wales, when Jeffreys, 47, followed and attacked in an alcohol-fuelled rage. Scroll down for video . Karen Catherall, 45, (right) was brutally murdered by Darren Jefferys (left) who she met on a dating site just weeks before her death. He was jailed for a minimum of 17 and a half years in February . He only called paramedics the following morning and claimed he thought Ms Catherall was sleeping, but later admitted murder and was jailed for life in February. Police have since told the family that the mother-of-two made a 999 call from her mobile just after she returned from the pub, which went through to BT to deal with. Operators at the telecommunications company connects both mobile and landline numbers with the requested emergency service and follow strict protocol. But when Ms Catherall called on September 13, last year, the call handler said they could not hear anything and therefore did not connect the call to the police or send help. Her mother, Glenys Keir, 74, and sister Lorraine Humphreys, 49, have slammed BT for not taking action at the time which they claim could have saved their sister. However, BT says its handlers acted appropriately and in line with police guidance not to pass on calls where there is 'nothing to indicate there is any problem'. Mrs Keir said: 'When we found out Karen had been murdered our whole world fell apart. 'But as we were starting to come to terms with it all, to then hear that a 999 call had been made from her mobile the night she died, it stirred up all of those emotions we had felt when we first found out Karen had been killed.

The phone call was later enhanced by detectives, who discovered arguing could be heard in the background. Ms Catherall's family are calling on BT to review their procedures, and answer questions about the call. Mrs Keir said: 'Apparently the person who picked up believed there was silence at the end of the line. They must have assumed 999 had been dialled accidentally. 'It doesn't bear thinking about what might have happened if BT had connected the call to the police.' Ms Catherall's sister, Mrs Humphreys, a catering supervisor, added: 'You regularly hear of toddlers playing with their mum's mobile phone and ringing the emergency services by mistake. 'In those instances, the police often seem to trace the call and turn up on the doorstep. 'We want to know why that didn't happen when in this situation Karen so desperately needed their help. 'We know the police aren't to blame as they never received the call, but BT should be looking into this and reviewing their policies. 'The call might have been muffled or quiet at the other end of the line, but surely it's better to put it through to the police so they can send an officer and be safe rather than sorry. 'Who knows what the outcome might have been if they had reached her in time? We don't want any other families to lose a loved one and go through the pain we have.' A BT spokesman said: 'North Wales Police contacted BT on September 24, 2014 about whether we received an emergency call from a mobile phone number and we provided them with full details including a call recording. 'Our records show that we received the call at approximately 19.07 on September 13, 2014.

'Police forces have requested that we do not connect such calls to them and our operator correctly followed the call handling process requested by the police.' Ms Catherall's family (pictured outside court) are calling on BT to review their procedures following the call . The 999 emergency number was set up in London in June 1937 after five women were killed in a fire. A committee discussed how telephone operators could identify emergency calls and the easy to remember 999 number was born. It was later rolled out in Glasgow and extended to all major towns and cities by 1948. Since then it has expanded massively with an average of 597,000 calls a week across the UK. BT operators answer the initial call from both landlines and mobiles and find out which emergency service is required before connecting the caller. The handler has to quickly establish whether the call is genuine before transferring them. In instances where they are met with silence they ask the caller to respond by either making a noise or coughing. This can narrow down the number of accidental or prank calls made, which account for about half of the 31 million calls made annually. Of the remaining 15.5million, 52 per cent go to police, 41 per cent to ambulance service, six per cent for fire and one per cent to the coastguard and cave and mountain rescue services. The spokesman also explained that in cases where they get no response from the caller, the operator will ask whether they can make a noise or cough. In this instance Ms Catherall apparently made no response and the phone call was terminated. Detective Inspector Mark Hughes, senior investigating officer at North Wales Police, confirmed the call. He said: 'During the early evening of September 13, 2014, a 999 call was made from the mobile phone of Karen Catherall. 'The phone call was received by the telephone company operator and managed in accordance with their policy but not directed onto North Wales Police, nor in fact any police force.

Kompany gets up in the referee's face as the City captain shows his clear frustration at Selhurst Park . Palace fans weren't incredibly optimistic ahead of last night's clash. Here's why: City had recorded seven victories in a row against Palace. Alan Pardew's side had also failed to score in their last three league games against them. And to top it off, as Newcastle boss Pardew had lost his last eight league matches against City by an aggregate score of 23-3.

Charlene Bishop, who is 17 months old, went to feed her pony Taffee on Wednesday and was worried when she didn't meet her at the gate as normal. Her mother Danielle Flisher went to investigate and found the Shetland lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries. Sickening: Taffee the Shetland pony was\u00a0battered to death with a breeze block in the middle of the night in a brutal attack . The left side of Taffee's (left) skull was completely caved in, her left eye was battered outs of its socket and concrete was embedded in her brain . The left side of the pony's skull was completely caved in, her left eye was battered out of its socket and concrete was embedded in her brain. The five-year-old animal also had a broken leg and vets called to the field in Boxley, near Gillingham, Kent, had no option but to put the distressed pony down. Police believe Taffee was battered round the head with a breeze block sometime between 11pm on Tuesday night and 9am on Wednesday morning. Charlene, who had only owned 22in\u00a0Taffee for three months, visited her every day to groom and feed her and rode her every weekend. Ms Flisher, 19, said: 'I don't understand how anybody could be so sick. 'Taffee was a tiny pony. The vet said she was hit over and over again and it looks like by was more than one person. 'It seems they held her head collar while they beat her. Taffee was crying blood from the damage they did to her skull. Vile: The Shetland was found lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries after the brutal attack . 'We got Taffee for Charlene when she was diagnosed with epilepsy. She can't do the same things as everyone else, but she loved spending time with me at the yard and had Taffee to keep her happy. 'They weren't together long but they were amazing. Charlene would climb all over her and Taffee wouldn't mind. 'Charlene would even sometimes tell Taffee off and the pony would go and stand in the corner of the stable like a naughty child. 'She's lost her best friend and she's devastated.' Taffee had a foal, 10-month-old Biscuit, who the family are now in the process of finding a surrogate mother for. Charlene, who is 17 months old, was bought the pony to help deal with her epilepsy and has lost her 'best friend', her mother said . Ms Flisher, a mother-of-two, added: 'I can't believe there are people out there who would do this to a tiny, defenceless pony. 'They would have seen she belonged to a child, she even had a Frozen rug on. 'Charlene doesn't understand death. She saw that Taffee was bleeding but when she woke up this morning she just assumed she was better and asked to go and feed her. It's heartbreaking, we don't know what to do.' Kent Police and the RSPCA are investigating the attack. Three other horses in the same field were shaved in places in the overnight attack and another had a small wound to its head. The family have offered a \u00a31,000 reward for anybody who can reveal those behind the attack. An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'This sounds like an incredibly upsetting incident.

The\u00a0Conservatives yesterday returned a donation of \u00a350,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But last night it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. The revelation by the Independent newspaper will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe. Last week his party's manifesto pledged to raise \u00a35 billion from clamping down on tax avoidance during the next Parliament. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans. Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.' Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than \u00a350,000 to the Conservatives. She and her husband were close friends of Margaret Thatcher and were guests of the Reagans at the White House. In his memoirs, her husband said he only pleaded guilty to get the US authorities to leave his family in peace. The revelation  will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe . He wrote: 'It was galling to listen to these vast sums of money being referred to as though they were merely numbers and to the fact that I had agreed to hand all this money to the US Government. 'But the future peace and security of the family which this agreement would secure meant that I could see advantage in what I was about to do. But that did not make it right.' A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Tollman told the Independent: 'In so far as Mrs Tollman is concerned you will see she is of good character and was acquitted of all charges.' Responding to Mr Tollman's guilty plea, a spokesman said: 'Stanley Tollman admitted to having failed to report on his US tax return two bank accounts situated outside the US. It was that omission for which he was sentenced to one day's unsupervised probation.

But the stunt sparked outrage from the Costa Rican Tourism Institute, the presidential palace and the Foreign Ministry. As Ecuador residents arrived, not in Costa Rica but another Ecuador airport, Tena, where they were given fake stamps in their passports as they went through a staged passport control. No attention to detail was spared as huge posters were placed over the welcome billboards at the airport. Adverts depicting Imperial beer and 'Esencial Costa Rica,' Costa Rica's national brand,  were displayed in the airport to throw the group off the scent. Even fictitious immigration documents and car licence plates were created to make the group think they were in Golfito, a port town in Costa Rica. On top of all that organisers used mobile phone and GPS blockers to keep passengers from using technology to discover the hoax. The Tame airline staged the prank in a bid to demonstrate that Ecuador should be considered a top tourist destination . A fake passport control was set up, which even gave out fake stamps for passports . The unsuspecting tourists took part in a number of exciting activities, from white water rafting to hiking . The prank was captured by video but following complaints, the tourism organisers in Ecuador took the video down.

'The Ambassador Alejandro Solado spoke with the highest Ecuadorian authorities about the display in the publicity video and the South American country will take the post down from the Internet.'

An American transgender woman is preparing to move to the UK to marry a bride she has never met in order to fulfil a 'lifelong dream' of becoming a British citizen. Hayley Carney will undergo surgery to complete her gender transition before moving to live with her fiancee, identified only as Anne, in Plymouth, Devon, later this year. She will then have six months to apply for a marriage visa, which, if successful, will set her on the path to citizenship. Ms Carney, formerly known as Robert, said she has been dreaming of a life in Britain since reading books about it as a child. She added that she feels the nation is more accepting of 'people like her'. But it was only after meeting Anne in an online support group that she decided to make a move to the country she 'has always wanted to call home'. She said: '[Anne] told me months ago that my life would be more comfortable in England, not only because my heart has always been there, but overall Britain is more openly accepting of people like me.

I have several friends I have made over the years and they really are some of the best friends anyone could ask for.

Ms Carney intends to move to the UK and search for a job before applying for a visa. She said:\u00a0'Immigration is a huge concern of mine.

Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry .

A campaign video sees Dr Vivek Murthy and the Sesame Street favourite go through the process of getting vaccinated and explaining to children (and parents) why it is so important. In what appears to be a direct response to anti-vaccination campaigners, Elmo and Dr Murthy questions why everybody does not get a shot. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Elmo explain why getting vaccinated is crucial to keep other children safe and healthy . As Dr Murthy visits Sesame Street, Elmo tells him he is 'worried about getting a shot,' asking the Surgeon General: 'Why does everyone need a vaccination, anyway?' In response Dr Murthy compares getting vaccinated to using an umbrella when it rains and wearing a helmet on a bike. This calms Elmo who gets the shot he needs, and after realising how quick and painless it is to get a shot, he asks Dr Murthy whey everybody doesn't get a vaccination? 'That's a good question, Elmo,' Murthy says, looking at the camera. 'That's a good question.' The video, produced by the Daily Dot, is accompanied by a shorter 30-second video of Elmo and the Surgeon General released by the Department of Health and Human Services.

It sees Dr Murthy explains that the best way Elmo can help him to do his job and keeping Americans healthy, is by getting 'all his Sesame Street friends' vaccinated too. The campaign videos have been released in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December, sickened 147 people in the U.S., which has seen the debate over vaccination flare up. Officials at the California Department of Public Health said no new infections have been reported for the past 42 days \u2014 or two incubation periods \u2014 meaning the outbreak is over in the U.S. Many who fell ill in the Disneyland episode were not immunized against measles. Some cited personal reasons for refusing shots, and others were too young to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. In California, where 131 of the 147 measles cases could be found, a vaccination bill has generated intense debates pitting personal rights against public health. The campaign videos have been released amidst debate across the United States over whether vaccines should be compulsory in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December . The measure would bar parents from seeking vaccine exemptions for their children because of religious or personal beliefs, joining California with Mississippi and West Virginia in such strict requirements. Medical waivers would only be available for children with health problems, forcing unvaccinated children to be homeschooled. California lawmakers were set to vote on the bill last week, but this was postponed by supporters postponed so authors could work on revisions to address concerns raised in the Senate Education Committee.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 0, "document": "Want to know what Australians get up to when the lights go out? One in five admit to doing a spot of online shopping in bed at night, according to a new study. The nocturnal shopping sprees are likely down to the 86 per cent of those surveyed who admit to turning to online retailers to purchase items that they are too embarrassed to buy in stores. The things considered too awkward for first person purchases include underwear, hair removal cream, personal hygiene products,  medication... and action figures. Nocturnal shopping spree: One in five Australians shop online at night in bed, while 86 per cent to going online for items they're too embarrassed to buy in store . And this is the least of stealthy shopper habits. The study, released by the\u00a0StarTrack Online Retail Industry Awards,  found work will often take a back seat when online shopping is only a click away. More than 27 per cent of Australians confess to shopping online at work and 3 per cent even took a sick day  to be able to sign for online orders when they arrived at home. These cunning capers even extend into the offline world, with 24 per cent of shoppers confessing to trying an item on in-store with the intention of buying it online later. Confessions of a shopaholic: 13 per cent of those surveyed admit to online shopping three to four times per day . Shoppers were also found to great covert lengths to keep online shopping habits a secret from their partner, friends or  boss. With  savvy shopping skills at play, it's no surprise then that Australians admit they are online addicts. Of those surveyed, most admitted to shopping up to twice a day and 13 per cent will click through online stores three to four times a day (equivalent to 4.6 hours a week). So how much are we spending? Three-quarters of Australians will spend up to $300 per month or at least $3,600 per year, according to StarTrack. Read below to find out which type you are... 1. THE SNEAKY SHOPPER . 2. THE BLUSHING BUYER . 3. THE ADDICT . 4. THE COVERT CONSUMER . 5. THE BIG SPENDER . This old thing? Covert consumers go to great lengths to hide purchases from partners, friends and family . Pairing this alongside a recent Commonwealth Bank survey that found\u00a0six million Australians were estimated to  shop online at Christmas alone, it seems online is our new go-to shopping choice. 'The relationship we have with our favourite online stores is personal and is at times extremely intimate,' Executive Chairman of the National Online Retailers Association Paul Greenberg said.

Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters attempting to reach IS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq. Over the past three months more than a dozen Britons, including three teenage schoolgirls, have made the journey. The arrests came as Scotland Yard revealed counter terrorism officers detained a 19-year-old at Luton Airport on Tuesday as he returned from Istanbul. Yahya Rashid is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group in Syria. He is accused of accompanying the group as they travelled to Morocco and then on to Turkey in November. hey are believed to have slipped across the border into Syria before Rashid flew home. He was remanded in custody by Westminster magistrates yesterday to appear at the Old Bailey accused of preparing to commit an act of terror and assisting others in preparing to commit acts of terror. More than 22,000 foreign fighters are now believed to have joined Islamic State from around 100 countries.

Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, found the 3.69-carat white diamond in a 37.5-acre search field on Thursday, her last day of a trip to the park with her husband. Clark, who first visited the park 33 years ago with her mother and grandmother, prayed to God, asking, 'Are you doing to bless me and let me find a diamond today?' as she searched the field. Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, Arkansas, found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas . Clark named the pinto-bean-sized, teardrop-shaped gem a 'hallelujah diamond' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something . And shortly after praying, Clark said she spotted the diamond sticking out of a ridge of plowed dirt, according to Region 8. She named the teardrop-shaped diamond the Hallelujah Diamond, claiming that her prayer helped her find the gem. Clark plans to keep the pinto-sized diamond, which is the largest diamond of the 122 found in the park this year. Crater of Diamonds State Park holds the only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public, in the form of a large plowed search field. 'The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent metallic shine,' park interpreter Waymon Cox told Region 8. 'It's the largest one found since April 16, 2014.' The search field had just been plowed earlier in the week because the park had seen a lot of rain, Cox said. 'This regular endeavor loosens the diamond-bearing soil which, along with rain erosion, brings more diamonds to the surface and helps park visitors' chances of finding them,' he said.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 0, "document": "Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today. The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon\u00a0that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government. An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow.\u00a0Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ding-dong: Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming \u2014 the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers. But Comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions.

To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten \u2018everyday emergencies\u2019 - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8.

To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it\u2019s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world\u2019s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it\u2019s locked.

Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United . Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters . Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final . He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday . The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes . The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey . The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season . He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas . De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea . De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318million . All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Anti-Semitic attacks surged worldwide by 38 per cent last year, with the highest number of incidents occurring in France, an annual study has revealed. The report, by Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry, said 766 violent anti-Semitic acts were carried out around the world last year - marking a huge increase from the previous year. Arson, vandalism and direct threats against Jews, synagogues and other Jewish institutions were included in the figure, making 2014 the worst year for such attacks since 2009. The study said: 'The overall feeling among many Jewish people is one of living in an intensifying anti-Jewish environment that has become not only insulting and threatening, but outright dangerous. In particular, it cited 'alarming reports especially from Western Europe and North America'. Anger in Western Europe over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip last July and August, as well as anti-Jewish caricatures in the media and social networks had helped to turn anti-Semitism into an 'almost daily phenomena seen and felt in every sphere of life', the report said. In France, the number of anti-Semitic attacks rose to 164 in 2014 compared with 141 in 2013. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in violence that began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly. Britain registered 141 violent incidents against Jews in 2014, after 95 a year earlier.

The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail.

On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.'

And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California.

Four-year-old Hudea was pictured late last year by photographer Osman Sagirli in Atmeh refugee camp, just 10km from the border with Turkey. She, her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the Syrian camp since Hudea's father was killed in the 2012 Hama massacre. But two weeks ago, the family took a fateful decision to move south, towards the city of Idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of Al Qaeda's brutal Syrian affiliate at the weekend. It means, once more, the family are in danger of becoming victims of a battle between the regime and rebels which has killed 220,000 since 2011 - 10,000 of whom were children. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Taken at the Atmeh refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey, the image shows four-year-old Hudea frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed . Hudea and her family left the camp two weeks ago; it is thought they headed for Idlib - now in the control of Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra. Pictured: An Al-Nusra fighter holds his group flag  in front of Idlib's governor building . Sharia law: Al-Nusra have promised to bring in Sharia law in the city, and have already started burning things considered banned under Islam - like these cigarettes . The Nusra Front-led rebels is set impose Sharia law on the city, which is only the second state capital to fall from the grip of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. 'We salute the people of Idlib and their stand with their sons, the Mujahideen, ... and God willing they will enjoy the justice of sharia, which will preserve their religion and their blood,' said Abu Mohamad al-Golani, Nusra Front's leader, in a recording released on Wednesday. This is horrifying news for those living under the Nusra Front. The group\u00a0group has a reputation for violence which is only rivaled by the horrors seen in ISIS-controlled territory. Charlie Winter, of the Qilliam Foundation, warned: 'Jabhat al-Nusra is an outspoken al-Qaeda affiliate. It espouses a severe interpretation of Islam and sharia law. 'They have been known to execute women who are allegedly running brothels, and stone adulterers. It is a violent interpretation of sharia law.' Indeed, the group appears to be all but following in the footsteps of ISIS, who have terrified the world with an onslaught of violence, including throwing people from the tops of buildings and getting small children to shoot so-called spies dead. Worringly, the Nusra Front - who reiterated their allegiance to Al Qaeda in the last month - have said they want to create their own 'Islamic state'. The group is known for its use of suicide bombers as it tries to achieve its goal, and has claimed\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0mass executions, murdered journalists and even priests in the past few years. In the days since they took control of Idlib, there have been reports of two Christian men being executed, while the Vatican - citing local news sources - claimed a Greek Orthodox priest had been kidnapped by jihadists. Fight: The city fell after a four day battle which saw fighters on both sides lose their lives . Flee: It is thought about 15,000 people ran from the city as the Nusra Front approached . Trauma: Save the Children reports many of the children were traumatised by what they had seen . For a child like Hudea, who has clearly already been left horribly traumatised by a war which has been raging her entire life, life under the strict sharia law is likely to be nothing be more terrifying. But life is no better under the Syrian regime: indeed, it is al-Assad's fighters who were said to be behind the Hama massacre in which she lost her father. Pro-government militia killed at least 55 people that day, going from house to house, murdering men, women and children. It was after this the family fled north, to the camp near the border with Turkey, which has grown to become a home to 30,000 refugees. But despite being so close to the safety of Turkey, the family appear to have never made it across. Instead, for reasons unknown to MailOnline's source within the camp, they decided to leave the camp - venturing out into territory which has changed hands between the different rebel factions and the al-Assad regime numerous times over the last four years. The MailOnline's source within the camp said: 'The child does not exist now in the camp. They fled to a village in Idlib about two weeks ago.' Wherever they have gone, it means the family are trapped once more between three violent sides - none of which are prepared to stop until they have wiped the other off the face of the earth. Relative safety: Many of the 15,000 are headed to refugee camps like Atmeh, near the Turkish border - but it is not known where Hudea and her small family are . Civil war: Fighting has been going on Hudea's entire life, killing 10,000 children since 2011. Pictured: Atmeh, her home after he father was killed in 2012 . And living in an area recently won by one side, does not guarantee survival - or peace. A source in the Syrian military force told EA World View: 'We have an obligation to liberate the city... I swear to god the highest we are not scared.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at University of Oklahoma, was also certain Damascus would not give up without a fight. He told\u00a0Bloomberg:\u00a0'Assad will likely bomb Idlib so that its captors find little peace in their new prize.' Mr Winter thinks it is unlikely they will have gone to areas controlled by the Syrian government. One suspects the memory of what they did to her husband will mean Hudea's mother will keep her family away from al-Assad's forces. But villages not in the control of the regime have come under attack since Nusra Front's assault on Idlib - which itself sent 15,000 people fleeing for their lives. Ironically, many are making their way to the refugee camps in the north - like Atmeh, the safe haven Hudea has just left. And now there are reports of the regime using chlorine-filled bombs against the towns\u00a0surrounding\u00a0Idlib - a new horror for the little girl and her family to contend with.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 0, "document": "Dunkin Donuts unveiled a new spring menu earlier this week, prompting a flurry of excitement from the food chain's biggest fans - and a series of serious warnings from health experts about the calorie-laden food options, some of which contain more than half of an adult's recommended daily intake of salt. The new menu contains five new food options - two 340-calorie cheesecake-filled donuts, one 380-calorie loaded bagel, one 640-calorie chicken-filled pretzel bun and a 'low fat' 210-calorie steak and cheese wrap. 'This new menu is laden with calories and fat. Many of these calories are considered \"empty calories\" meaning that they have little or no nutritional value,' cardiologist Dr Kevin Campbell told Daily Mail Online. Warnings: Dunkin Donuts' new spring menu features the 640-calorie\u00a0Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich which contains 68 per cent of your daily allowance of salt . Sweet tooth? The new menu also features two new flavors of the chain's Cheesecake Square Donuts, which each contain upwards of 340 calories . Obesity and obesity-related illness has become epidemic; in the US alone obesity and obesity-related illness accounts for a $150 billion dollars of healthcare expenditures annually . 'As adults we must set good examples for our children because they pattern our behavior we must avoid eating food such as these presented on the new menu at Dunkin' Donuts.' Indeed, the food chain's new Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich - which is described on the Dunkin Donuts website as containing 'delicious breaded chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon and honey mustard' which are all \u00a0'served on an oven-toasted pretzel bun' - contains a whopping 640 calories, almost a third of your recommended daily intake. Additionally, the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale, which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg. The roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake. And when paired with one of Dunkin Donuts' new ice cream-inspired coffee flavors - Rocky Road Swirl, Butter Pecan Swirl, or Cookie Dough Swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal, if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee. Another option listed on the new menu is the Southwest Supreme Bagel, which is stuffed with cheese, corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes, onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake. Something savory: The\u00a0Southwest Supreme Bagel contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt . Healthy? The 210-calorie Snack N\u2019 Go Steak Wrap is intended to be a low-calorie alternative to the other menu options, however it still contains 25 per cent of your daily saturated fat intake . Healthier than the pretzel roll, yes, but still not the most nutritious treat around. Indeed, the only 'healthy' option offered on the new menu is a small Snack N\u2019 Go Steak Wrap, a 210-calorie snack that contains 'our delicious angus steak, a slice of cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce, wrapped in a warm tortilla'. But while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier, low-calorie option, it still contains five grams of saturated fats, which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake. Last, but not least, the menu also contains two new varieties of Dunkin Donuts' signature Cheesecake Square Donut, which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling, this time in Oreo and raspberry flavors. And while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the Dunkin website, the standard Cheesecake Square Donut contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance. Unsurprisingly, the chain's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health-conscious Twitter users to voice their concerns over the calorie-laden choices.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Gwyneth Paltrow has vowed to live on just $29 worth of food for a week, after agreeing to take on a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness and funds for New York's food banks. The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)If one is to believe lawyers for Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend, his future brother-in-law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain-smoked. The jury in the high-profile trial resumed deliberations Wednesday after deliberating about an hour-and-a-half on Tuesday. The way defense lawyer James Sultan laid it out for the Massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier Tuesday, why would a young man with a $40 million contract kill semi-pro player Odin Lloyd less than a mile from his own home? Why would Hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene? Did those who Sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the National Football League? \"If there was evidence of any reason Aaron would have had to murder Odin Loyd, don't you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks?\" Sultan asked the jury. \"You didn't hear it because it doesn't exist.\" The prosecution, however, portrayed Hernandez as cold, calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention, one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others. Prosecutor William McCauley asked jurors: What was Hernandez talking about a day after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found at a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013? \" 'My endorsements are gone,' \" Hernandez said, according to McCauley said. \"He's not talking about Odin.\" The state's largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and the presentation of more than 400 pieces of evidence. On Monday, Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story in less than a day. In closing arguments the next day, Sultan sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that Hernandez orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt. Even if they found a strong likelihood that Hernandez was involved, the lawyer said, \"That's not enough.\" Sultan tried to implicate Hernandez's co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The defense described Wallace and Ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on PCP, as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage. They're accused of killing Lloyd. \"Did he make all the right decisions? No,\" Sultan said of his client. \"He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something, committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another. Keep in mind, he's not charged with accessory after the fact. ... He's charged with murder ... and that he did not do.\" The prosecution said Wallace and Ortiz were longtime friends of Hernandez, who had complete control of them. McCauley reminded the jury of testimony about Hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies, and Hernandez at times leaving his then 8-month-old child with the two men. \"These guys ... will do whatever he wants,\" the prosecutor said of Hernandez. The motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out, but prosecutors said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They said Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score. McCauley said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone -- such as disrespect -- would easily offend Hernandez. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, testified that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box. The prosecution has said the murder weapon, which has not been recovered, was in the box. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Jenkins said she threw it away in \"a random dumpster\" but could not remember where. Another piece of the state's case was grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park, which is about a mile from Hernandez's home. The video is time-stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving. Hernandez's lawyers showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand. They suggested it was an iPad. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012, almost a year before Lloyd was killed. He will be tried in that case after the Lloyd trial. The jury has not heard about the double shooting.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Watching George Osborne enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider and a chat with the locals in a Somerset pub garden, it is hard to believe that only three years ago he was virtually scared to leave the safety of his Treasury office. He felt besieged and intimidated. There was little evidence his hardline \u2018austerity Britain\u2019 policies were working. His nervy demeanour and pallid complexion reflected the sickly economy. In the eyes of critics he was a hate figure \u2013 and it was getting to him. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically, and I got myself into a position where I was hunkered down in the Treasury,\u2019 George Osborne drinks a pint of Somerset cider as he is interviewed by Political Editor Simon Walters at The Cotley Inn, near Chard, Somerset . Osborne reflects as we chat at the Cotley Inn in Chard during a break in an Election campaign tour of the South West. \u2018I was saying, look, if people don\u2019t like the plan or whatever, well, you know\u2026 so be it.\u2019 The nadir came when the Chancellor was booed at the Paralympic Games. Worse, it happened in front of his children, Luke and Liberty, now aged 13 and 11. Did he feel he couldn\u2019t take any more? \u2018I never personally felt, erm, low,\u2019 he says slowly, giving a rare glimpse of his emotions. \u2018But I\u2019m not going to pretend it was easy. \u2018The most difficult thing was explaining it to my children \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy conversation to have.\u2019 Osborne has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the Paralympics to being credited with helping to turn Britain's economy around . Osborne did not consider throwing in the towel, but he knew that he had to break out of his Treasury bunker. \u2018I thought, hold on, you cannot do this in this job \u2013 you have to go out and explain yourself, meet people, expose yourself to fresh ideas.\u2019 He gestures with outstretched arms, hands clenched, recalling the moment he got a grip. Since then, confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the Chancellor himself. And he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically. He went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st. On the day of our interview, a national newspaper compared the new-look Osborne to dashing Latin heart-throb actor Antonio Banderas \u2013 quite a change from the days when he was derided as a Regency fop. \u2018It\u2019s definitely moving in the right direction!\u2019 he laughs. More waspish and engaging than David Cameron in private, Osborne has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public. It is one of the reasons he stood aside when Cameron ran for the Tory Party leadership. He is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat \u2013 a basic skill required by modern leaders. His sense of isolation in his early days as Chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife Frances\u2019s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in London instead of moving to Downing Street. They thought it would make it easier to preserve a \u2018normal\u2019 family life.\u00a0It did the opposite. \u2018I never saw the kids or Frances, because I was up so early and back late,\u2019 Osborne says. His morale improved dramatically when the family did move into Downing Street, one of the few U-turns Osborne has made. \u2018I see the children all the time now, in the morning, and I can pop up in the early afternoon if I\u2019m going out in the evening,\u2019 he says cheerily. \u2018I feel very lucky.\u2019 Osborne also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying Britain under Labour will mimic France's course since it voted in socialist Francois Hollande as president . Osborne\u2019s tour of the West Country has been designed to target seats where the Tories are fighting the Lib Dems. At Hawkins Garage in St Austell, Cornwall, to promote the Government\u2019s apprenticeship scheme, the Chancellor was shown by 17-year-old trainee mechanic Dale Wilkes how to drain a car sump. Osborne\u2019s hand ended up drenched in oil. If he had been asked to do it in his \u2018hunkered down\u2019 phase he would have found it torture. Here, with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls, it wasn\u2019t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as Dale passed him a spanner. From St Austell it was back to\u00a0Somerset and Yeovil, where Osborne hopes the Tory candidate will unseat Lib Dem David Laws who was, until two weeks ago, a Coalition colleague. Osborne was such a fan of Laws that when the Coalition was formed in 2010, he made Laws his deputy, stating that he was \u2018put on earth to be Treasury Chief Secretary\u2019. \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t last long in that position!\u2019 hoots Osborne with a fiendish grin. Laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an MPs\u2019 expenses scandal which led to him being painfully \u2018outed\u2019 as gay. Osborne\u2019s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem who succeeded Laws as Osborne\u2019s Treasury deputy, claimed that an unnamed \u2018very senior Tory\u2019 told him: \u2018You take care of the workers, we\u2019ll take care of the bosses.\u2019 Was it Osborne who said it, as many suspected? \u2018No,\u2019 the Chancellor snaps. But if he has rescued the economy and Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are so useless, as he always claims, why aren\u2019t the Conservatives ahead in the polls? Is it time to press the panic button? \u2018The campaign is going as we wanted it to,\u2019 he insists. Really? \u2018Yes. We always thought it would be close.\u2019 Mr Osborne said he never 'personally felt low' about being booed at the Paralympics in 2012, but had to explain it to his children . But Miliband is proving more resilient than the Tories expected. \u2018Only because he\u2019s standing behind podiums in front of Labour supporters,\u2019 he mocks. Tory MPs claim that their party\u2019s campaign lacks passion and that Cameron\u2019s Australian election guru, Lynton Crosby, is too aggressive and too powerful. Osborne stands foursquare behind them: \u2018David Cameron leads this Election campaign from the front.\u2019 It provokes him into showing some passion of his own. \u2018I\u2019m not about to hand over the keys to No 11 to Ed Balls, saying, \u201cGo and wreck all the good work we\u2019ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country.\u201d Absolutely not!\u2019 The one U-turn Osborne has made during the last five years is moving his wife Frances (pictured) and their children to No 11 Downing Street, so he can be closer to them . He says that if Labour wins, Britain will become an economic basket case like France did after socialist Francois Hollande won power. \u2018France is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour, jobs go, debts pile up. People will say, \u201cMy God, Britain is going backward instead of forward.\u201d Osborne is in his stride now, spitting venom. \u2018All this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from Labour about standing up for\u00a0the many not the few\u2026 the people who suffer most when Labour governments screw up the economy are the poorest.\u2019 A measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month Cameron named Osborne as one of three potential successors \u2013 and no one laughed. So would he like to become PM? \u2018I\u2019m not a politician who spends my life thinking, \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d and \u201cWhat when\u2026?\u201d \u2019 Rot, he can be every bit as calculating as Labour\u2019s Machiavellian Peter Mandelson, we tease him. \u2018I\u2019m not rising to that!\u2019 he laughs. Osborne was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his Tatton constituency, combining politics with a family day out. He was accompanied by Frances, a successful author and daughter of former Tory Minister Lord David Howell, and Luke and Liberty. \u2018We\u2019re all really looking forward to the Election. The children are interested in it. My son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones,\u2019 he chuckles. \u2018Then The Voice came on TV and we switched over to that.\u2019 With that, Osborne takes another sip of his Somerset cider, aptly called Thatchers Gold. It slakes Osborne\u2019s thirst for now. But he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the Tories don\u2019t win Election gold on May 7.", "claim": "george osborne enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider. in the eyes of critics

The main reasons for this were said to be 'showing off in front of friends' and 'succumbing to peer pressure and buying things we wouldn't ordinary buy'. Peer pressure: 64 per cent of adults think they spend more money when they go shopping with friends, many blaming the urge to 'show off' Nearly half of the participants (45 per cent) blamed the fact that they get carried away by excitement when they shop with friends.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement. But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home. In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business. And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo \u2013 which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses \u2013 has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors. Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s . At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire. At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat. Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale. 'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57. 'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.' He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business . The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss . He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world. 'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away \u2013 but it wasn't a problem. I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.' Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors. Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel. He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean. 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007. 'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.' The four-bedroom home is now on the market for \u00a3599,000. At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building . The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat \u2013 and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s. But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself. In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village. It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own \u2013 the very property that Branson would one day end up converting. Price: \u00a3599,000 . Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson; former Wesleyan chapel in the village where John Wesley gave his first sermon . At the time of his first sermon, Wesley was studying at Oxford University. The Jacobean pulpit in St James the Great bears a plaque commemorating the sermon, which is reputed to have lasted two-and-a-half hours. 'We were looking for a property in South Leigh as we had friends in the area,' says recently separated Rowan, 50 \u2013 a management consultant with two children, Jacob, 15, and Nancy, 13. 'We fell in love with the house the moment we saw it.' Rowan only found out Branson had been a previous owner on his second viewing. 'That undoubtedly increased our interest, especially when we realised what an excellent job he had done converting it into a home, without losing too many of its original features,' said Rowan. 'And the house ticked all the boxes for us. It has lots of space and is conveniently located for the A40, with good access to London.' At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, pictured is the kitchen . The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden . The building is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout it. Features that Branson added include pine banisters and large round windows offering views across surrounding countryside. The property has an en suite and family bathroom, and the master bedroom overlooks the back garden. A studio room could be used as an office or fifth bedroom. The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden. A kitchen and third reception room complete the accommodation.

Four in ten Britons have an average \u00a377 of unwanted good because they have not got round to returning it . A fifth (21 per cent) are too busy, believing that it takes nearly half an hour to return something each time, suggesting time is put ahead of hard earned cash. Confusing processes were also identified as a major deterrent to sending an item back for 22 per cent. The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer. Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items. Amongst the most commonly unreturned items were women's dresses, shoes and trousers, which occupied the top three spots. Then came women's shirts or blouses, women's jeans, electrical equipment, women's jackets, homeware, jewellery and women's underwear, according to the One Poll survey of 2,000 people. Most people say it is simply too inconvenient to return the item, or not worth the cost . Doddle has introduced changing rooms to a number of its stores to make trying and returning online purchases, easier. The facilities allow customers to collect, try and return, online unsuitable items. Chief executive Tim Robinson said: 'Customers have become so frustrated with the processes for returning online purchases that they would rather forgo the cash from the refund, to skip the lengthy and inconvenient queues associated with the task. 'But it doesn't have to be this way. We launched Doddle so that customers can collect and return online purchases in less than two minutes.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "A Facebook post and a Craigslist ad worked together to solve the 34-year-old cold case murder of a teenage girl from Michigan who was found stabbed nine times in the woods in rural Louisiana. Carol Cole was 17 years old when she disappeared without a trace after running away from a juvenile detention center in Texas in October 1980. In January 1981, police in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, found a teenage girl stabbed nine times in the back and chest stashed under a pile of leaves in the woods out of a dirt road outside Shreveport. For 34 years, Carol's family searched in vain for the troubled teen. At the same time, detectives from Bossier Parish never stopped trying to identity the body they found mutilated in the woods. Coming together: The picture at left is the image used by Carol Cole's family on Craigslist posts across Texas and Louisiana. The image at right is a rendering of 'Bossier Doe' created for a Facebook page posted by detectives in an attempt to identify a body found in January 1981 . Carol Cole escaped from a Texas juvenile jail in October 1980 after moving from Michigan with her mother. Her remains have been found and identified after 34 years . Relieved: Carol Cole's sister, Jeanie Phelps of Kalamazoo, Michigan, (center) with Bossier Sheriff's Lt. Shannon Mack and Sgt. Dave Faulk . Now, social media has brought Carol's family and Louisiana detectives together. In February, DNA confirmed that the body in Louisiana matched missing Carol's DNA, the Detroit News\u00a0reports. New attention to the case has brought forward a potential suspect, as well. John Chesson, who is already in prison for an unrelated murder, is named as a person of interest in Carol's brutal death . Carol's sister Jeanie Phelps\u00a0and her friend posted Craigslist ads across Texas and Louisiana with pictures of the teen, hoping someone might recognize her. At the same time, Bossier Parish Lieutenant Shannon Mack crated a Facebook post for 'Bossier Doe' (Facebook doesn't allow Jane Doe page names). It included a digitally-rendered drawing of the victim based on her skeletal remains. Carol's family aznd Bossier detectives made a connection six days later when Bossier Parish 911 dispatcher Linda Erickson was trolling through Craigslist. Long road: Cole, from Michigan, was eventually found dead in Louisiana. She was last heard from in December 1980 and found dad a month later . These are the shoes that Carol was wearing when she was found dead. Police posted pictures of them in the hopes of jogging the memory of anyone who may have known her . Person of interest: John Chesson has been identified as a possible suspect by his own daughter. He's currently in prison for an unrelated murder . She had seen the Facebook page posted by detectives in her department. When she stumbled across Ms Phelps' Craigslist page, she realized that the rendering of Bossier Doe and picture of Carol looked remarkably similar. 'I can't explain it other than this child was meant to have an identity,' Ms Erikson tells the News. Perhaps even more remarkable, authorities in Bossier and Carol's family had crossed each other's paths some 30 years ago in a failed attempt to find the teen and identify the body. A coroner in the early 1980s examined the remains to see whether they matched Carol's description - but he said they weren't close enough for further investigation. Ms Phelps, Carol's sister, also considered the Bossier remains in the search for her missing sister - but says she must have glossed over them, WOOD-TV reports. All the new attention has also brought forward a potential suspect in Carol's murder. \u00a0Convicted murderer John Chesson's own daughter told the News that media coverage of Carol's case jogged her memories that the teen had been staying at their house in 1980 before she disappeared. Frances LeBlanc says that her father was a violent, abusive man. And he was also the one who claimed to have found Carol's body in the woods and alerted police. Detectives have not filed charges, but say they are investigating whether Chesson murdered the teenager nearly 35 years ago. Carol's remains have been cremated and brought back to Michigan, where her family lives.

Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations.

'Men saw that as a sort of, \"Oh, fantastic! We can f*** anything, however we like, whenever we like! They're up for grabs, boys!\" It was that kind of attitude', she said. Mirren also said  revelations about celebrities from that era, such as Jimmy Savile, did not come as a surprise. 'I\u2019m sure that if that f****** bastard was alive today he would be utterly confused. He would think, \"They liked it, they loved me, I was a big star, so they wanted it\",' she said.

Mirren was speaking ahead of the release of her new film, Woman In Gold, and last week posed on the red carpet with co-star Ryan Reynolds. Indeed, the 38-year-old's eyes were fixed on the 69-year-old's decolletage as they posed for photos at their film's Berlin premiere. And the actor's wife, Blake Lively, shared a snap of the flirty moment with her Instagram fans - joking that she had reason to feel jealous. 'Should I be concerned that my husband's never looked at me this way?...' the 27-year-old quipped in the photo's caption on Saturday. Mirren, pictured in the mid 1970s, was speaking ahead of the release of her new film, Woman In Gold . In her Instagram post she called the Oscar-winning actress 'sexy' and noted that her husband of two years took a gander at her cleavage, writing: '#WhereAreThoseEyesWanderingReynolds #HelenMirrenIStheSexiestWomanAlive #WomanInGold.' Speaking to People, Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. 'You know, he makes a girl feel good,' she explained. 'Some guys don't. They're macho and attractive, but they make you feel awkward. 'Ryan just makes you feel so great. He's just so generous in his masculinity. He happens to be hunky and gorgeous and everything as well, but when you get a beautiful combination of the two? He is wonderful.' Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. In Woman In Gold, their on-screen chemistry is apparent as well. It is a real-life story about a Jewish refugee\u2019s battle against the Austrian government to reclaim a family painting stolen by Nazis. The biopic chronicles the heir's 60-year pursuit of Gustav Klimt's painting The Lady in Gold - which now ranks as the fifth most expensive painting ever sold at $135 million . Helen plays Maria Altmann, a woman who was forced to flee her home and life as a socialite in Vienna amid World War II. She enlists young lawyer Randol Schoenberg, played by Ryan, to help her restore her family's past. Considered the Mona Lisa of Austria, Klimt's 1907 The Lady In Gold painting is a portrait of Altmann's aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, a friend of the famed artist.

Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush\u2019s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush\u2019s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was \u2018crazy\u2019 with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova\u2019s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest:\u00a0\u2018We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.\u2019 Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of \u00a373,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years.

'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than \u00a359,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom. He said: 'I am sure that it will not be easy to sell this house - at least not for that money.'

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy hailed the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of players after a determined 1-1 draw at his former club Wolves moved Town closer to securing a place in the SkyBet Championship play-offs. Despite Wolves bouncing back to take a point through Benik Afobe's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a Richard Stearman own goal had given Ipswich a first-half lead, Town's play-off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining. Former Wolves boss McCarthy was delighted with his side's determined display and he said: 'It was a good performance and a good point. It is very pleasing. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were denied three points as rivals Wolves fought back to draw 1-1 on Saturday . 'Wolves were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great, stubborn, belligerent, professional performance - all those horrible words people don't like in football but I do because you win games and win leagues by doing that. 'We are always hard to beat and hard to play against. 'The first thing I said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent, stubborn, hard working, tough, horrible bunch you have turned out to be and I love you and I am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team. It is lovely to have. 'A lot of those qualities are probably the reasons why we are where we are. 'It takes a lot of things to be in the top six and there will be teams below us who are all playing sexy football but we are winning games and we are in the top six and we still have a chance of being promoted. 'So to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it I laugh at them and think it is comical because I think what we do we do well and isn't that what having a job is all about?' Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal . McCarthy, who was sacked by Wolves in February 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club, insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to Molineux. He added: 'I think I am very much liked and respected by the Wolves fans and I love the club and the people here so I don't think I have got anything to prove and I always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back. 'But I have taken the point and I am happy with that.' Although they trailed at the break, Wolves needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when Afobe stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with Nouha Dicko carrying their greatest. McCarthy hails the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of Ipswich players . They could not find a second goal, though, and their play-off hopes are now hanging by a thread. However, coach Kenny Jackett insisted they will not be throwing in the towel. He said: 'It is out of our hands and now we will need to win our final two games and other teams will need to lose. But you don't know what will happen. So we need to make sure that we go again next week. 'It is a tough call, we understand that. We will have to see how the table looks but one way or another we have to put in a good performance and give it everything we have got next week at Wigan. Kenny Jackett is still hopeful his Wolves side can secure a Championship play-off spot despite the 1-1 draw . 'If the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there.' He added: 'We gave it everything against Ipswich. I thought that we showed a lot of spirit, effort and energy in the second half when we pushed Ipswich all the way. The attitude and tempo was there.' 'Ultimately it is a better point for Ipswich than it is for us. We needed to win and I felt that we built up very well in the second half. We got a goal back early on but couldn't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute Ipswich defence.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.", "claim": "two cnn heroes are among the earthquake. anuradha koirala has a rehabilitation center to 425 young women and girls. they are struggling in the aftermath. public warned not to use main water line due to cholera. koirala is the founder of the nonprofit maiti nepal.", "cnndm_id": "dae2675302d92bdf0bbd6d35c3e473389f8bb5a1", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal.", "And they are struggling in the aftermath.", "Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls.", "While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12.", "The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry.", "\"We are suffering with rain, strong wind.", "The fear is not gone from us.", "It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year.", "The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera.", "Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food.", "Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster.", "\"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said.", "\"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse.", "Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything.", "...", "If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\"", "About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled.", "Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard.", "\"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said.", "\"Everything is broken in the hospice.\"", "Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged.", "\"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said.", "\"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it.", "I was not afraid that I was going to be killed.", "I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\"", "Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence.", "They are now living on the ground in a nearby field.", "\"Physically, we are not hurt.", "But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated.", "Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down.", "She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves.", "\"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said.", "\"We are really scared.\"", "They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says.", "But she is trying to stay positive.", "\"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?

Once in the capital, they were allegedly molested by politicians and other Establishment figures at Dolphin Square and Elm Guest House \u2013 which are now under investigation by Scotland Yard. Claims: Richard Kerr, 53, said he was abused by \u2018powerful people\u2019 in a Westminster paedophile ring . His account provides the first clear link between three alleged major VIP paedophile rings that operated in London and Northern Ireland. And the claims will add weight to calls for the allegations about the Irish children\u2019s home to be covered by the official abuse inquiry now being chaired by judge Lowell Goddard. Mr Kerr told how he suffered abuse at Kincora children\u2019s home in Belfast, where victims have accused MI5 of blocking police inquiries. He said he and two other boys were then trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse in two locations. He said he endured his most violent ordeal at Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London.

Mr Kerr, whose full interview will be broadcast by Channel 4 News at 7pm tonight, said the two boys from Kincora children\u2019s home who were taken to London with him both went on to kill themselves.

Hearn unveiled a cheque with his offer to Sky TV cameras in a bid to force a deal with the IBF super-bantamweight champion, as the Matchroom promoter upped the ante in a bid to book a July 18 date at Manchester Arena. However, Frampton\u2019s promoters, Cyclone Promotions, headed by former world champ Barry McGuigan, released a press release in response to the offer, claiming they were awaiting formal communication from Hearn\u2019s Matchroom Sports before renewing negotiations over the much-hyped bout. Eddie Hearn presents the cheque for \u00a31.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Matchroom Sport boss Hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight . Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' TV rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as Matchroom are tied to Sky Sports, while Frampton\u2019s recent title defence against Chris Avalos attracted millions of viewers between ITV in the UK and UTV Ireland. Now Hearn has seemingly attempted to force the fight with a big-money offer in the hope that the bout can be screened on Sky Box Office. While past negotiations were believed to have collapsed due to a failure to agree a deal on future promotional \u2018options\u2019 on fights, the Matchroom promoter also insisted he has not demanded rights to promote Frampton\u2019s future fights. \u2018Nothing at all \u2014 no options, no rematch clause, absolutely nothing,\u2019 Hearn told Sportsmail when questioned on whether such terms were included in his \u00a31.5m offer. \u2018He can have this fight, he can go back to whatever broadcaster he wants [after it]. He can go and move to the moon if he wants, it\u2019s nothing to do with us.\u2019 Quigg is the defending WBA super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight Frampton in Manchester . Quigg celebrates his win over Hidenori Othake at the Liverpool Echo Arena in November last year . McGuigan declined to comment further on the saga when contacted by Sportsmail, refusing to elaborate on Cyclone Promotions\u2019 statement which said they \u2018have made several attempts to organise a follow-up meeting with Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport to progress these negotiations\u2019. The Cyclone statement added: \u2018If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.\u2019 Hearn countered the Cyclone statement, telling Sportsmail: \u2018We just want to get it done, it\u2019s so frustrating\u2026 I know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that\u2019s because it was getting nowhere. We\u2019re trying to make things happen. \u2018The only thing that Cyclone Promotions want is they want to co-promote the show. We\u2019re bringing all the money, we\u2019re putting all the money up,\u2019 said the Matchroom promoter. \u2018If there was another broadcaster that they were willing to work with, who could throw a load of money at this fight, then make us an offer. They can\u2019t. We\u2019re in such a strong position, but we\u2019re still being fair. Scott Quigg is the one taking all the risk here. If it doesn\u2019t do that great at the box office, Scott might get only \u00a3400-500,000 and Carl still gets his \u00a31.5m, there is no risk.

The blue Audi pulls out from Whitchurch road, in Chester and accelerates into the side of the bus . It then collides into the bus as part of the \u00a31million 'crash for cash' scam that took place over three years . The elaborate fraud allowed passengers on the bus, who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam, to falsely claim from insurers . Smith, the managing director of Swift Accident Solutions, stage-managed the crashes around the Chester area over the three-year period, in a bid to create new claimants for his business. He then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than \u00a31million - to no win no fee lawyers. All of the bogus claims submitted by the Smith's company were for whiplash and 'soft tissue injuries,' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies. Instead, insurers were forced to rely on the individual claimants and usually settled out of court. John Smith (right), 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales is facing jail after stage-managing several collisions in a \u00a31m 'crash for cash' fraud; Luke McQuillan (left) was found guilty of\u00a0of conspiracy to commit fraud . Police uncovered Smith's plot after being alerted by First Direct insurance to the unusually high volume of claims. They also found more than 90 per cent\u00a0of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another. The majority were friends or relatives of the 12 defendants, the court was told. The court heard how Smith had introduced 177 new claimants to a lawyer for which he received \u00a3960 each time. Investigators later found that the bogus claims accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total gross income at Swift Accident Solutions during the period. Smith was convicted yesterday at Manchester Crown Court Smith of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, following a 41-day trial. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud. Four more people had already pleaded guilty to the charge, while two defendants were found not guilty.\u00a0Police believe more arrests will still be made over the scam. During the trial, the court was told how Smith masterminded the scam by finding drivers who were willing to carry out a fake crash. More than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another and were mainly said to be friends and relatives of the 12 defendants. Pictured: Richard Flynn (left) and Barry Cooper (right) were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud following the 41-day trial at Manchester Crown Court . The drivers would then pull out at low speed, using vehicles provided by Smith, and collide with the buses. The single and double decker buses had been chosen out of 'greed' because of the sheer number of claims that could be lodged, the court was told. Bus driver John Griffths told the court how he was caught up in one of the accidents while driving a park and ride bus towards Chester in June 2011. He told how he broke gently when he saw the Rover car pulling out of the side road, in a bid to prevent his standing passengers from being flung along the aisle. He added: 'I couldn't brake harshly because I had standing passengers, if I'd have done that they would have gone forward, so I had to go gently. The driver of the car said it was his fault, that his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator.' But he said one woman quickly reported that she 'wasn't feeling well'. He was also approached by three men, one of whom claimed he had hurt his leg on the bus steps, despite having no visible sign of injury. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud including Dean Brown, 42, (left) and Barry Cooper, 35 (right) When an ambulance was called to the scene, treatment was declined, he added. A passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the Rover driver, at a side junction, actually looking at the bus just before to the collision. Although there was a 'minimal jolt', a fellow passenger was overheard exclaiming 'oh my back', he said. Smith was also accused of making a false representation by not declaring two outstanding county court judgments when applying for a licence to operate his claims management business. After the case Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale from Chester CID said the force would continue to investigate the case. He said: 'This was an extremely complex investigation spanning nearly three years and involving a large number of defendants. 'It has been a challenging process for all officers involved and has required considerable professional skills in relation to the investigation and the subsequent prosecution. 'As part of our investigation conducted a significant number of interviews, to gather the required evidence to prove that Smith and his associates had stage these collisions for the sole purpose of financial gain. 'The crime that they committed was not a victimless crime, had all of the false claims created by Smith and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been over \u00a31 million, which would have been paid for by law abiding citizens through their car insurance policies.' Det Con Stephen Owens added: 'The Police have a duty to protect life, and although these collisions were all minor, they could have been much more serious. 'Yet despite the fact all of the collisions were minor, with minimal damage to both vehicles, they all resulted in multiple claims for personal injury claims, with the vast majority of these claims submitted via Smiths company.

'Through our investigations and the evidence we have gathered, we have been able to identify a \"passenger Network\" which shows that a large proportion of the claimants can be linked to each other.

{"filename": "test_chen18_reranked.json", "label": 1, "document": "Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was \u2018heavily geared\u2019 towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start \u2018shedding\u2019 jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could \u2018go stale\u2019 with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 \u2013 and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a \u2018job for life\u2019 meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly \u2018reskill\u2019 and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: \u2018The old model of training in youth and a \"career for life\" thereafter no longer applies\u2019. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master\u2019s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a \u2018lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks\u2019. Education:\u00a0A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification . Mark Farrar, of the AAT, said: \u2018Older generations are faced with the greatest barriers when it comes to reskilling. \u2018Given rapid economic and technological changes, many traditional jobs are less secure than in the past and older workers are increasingly facing the threat of redundancy. \u2018The UK\u2019s ageing population is growing and the increased retirement age means people are working for longer. \u2018The challenge is therefore to ensure people can continue to participate in the labour market at the later stage of their working lives.\u2019 According to the Office for National Statistics, workers aged 55 and over are less likely to be unemployed than younger workers. But older unemployed people are more likely to have been out of work for 12 months or longer, suggesting they find it harder to find a new job if they do find themselves out of work.

The spectacular isolated fort, one of three guarding the entrance to the Solent, just off the coast of the Isle of Wight, has been turned into a luxury impregnable haven complete with a rooftop hot tub, shops and even its own nightclub, thanks to a multi-million pound revamp. The unique hotel looks like could be a fortress of a James Bond villain and can sleep 44 guests with a capacity of 200 for parties and events. Scroll down for video . For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck for ocean views . The No Man's Fort has been transformed by AmaZing Venues to become a luxury hotel, and is set to open on April 23 . With four floors packed with a variety of entertaining facilities, it\u2019s a unique location that\u2019s sure to leave guests with unforgettable memories . The sea fort is located 2km out at sea, meaning guests have to make an exciting entrance by helicopter or by boat. On arrival at the ocean hotspot, guests can hit up the shops, restaurants, luxury spa, rooftop bar and firepit, cabaret bar, nightclub or LaZer Battle Arena. If water sports are more your style this is the perfect base for enjoying\u00a0RIB rides, jet biking, sea kayaking, or kite surfing. A spokesman for AmaZing Venues said: 'No Man's Fort is an inspiring private island that offers an unrivalled experience. 'It is three times the size of Spitbank Fort and boasts its own lighthouse with spectacular views across the Solent. 'You'd think being a mile offshore is unique enough, but we've crammed every possible space with unusual things to see and experience. Built between 1867 and 1880, No Man's Fort was one of several forts ordered by then-Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to fend off the French Navy. It needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. At the time it cost \u00a3462,500 to build, which with inflation would be equivalent to more than \u00a343million today. It was the first fort in England, and possibly Europe, to use hydraulic power to move the guns in horizontal and vertical planes for targeting and the first to be lighted throughout with electricity. The fort was in active use by the military up to 1957 - housing anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War - and became a scheduled ancient monument in 1967. A developer bought it in 1987 to convert it into a luxury residence but failed to find a millionaire buyer. Birmingham businessman Harmesh Pooni bought it to run as as a corporate hospitality venue but he ran into financial difficulties and had to close down. He eventually barricaded himself inside until he was removed. The fort eventually sold in 2009 for just \u00a3910,000. 'The potential of this magnificent sea fortress is only restrained by your imagination. 'A trip to the fort can be as relaxing or action-packed as you wish.

The modern fort has two helipad zones, as well as offering roof top BBQ facilities for an ocean-facing meal . Do not disturb! The fort boasts 23 luxury suites and can sleep 44 guests, with prices ranging from \u00a3450 per night . A room with a view! Not only does this hotel offer one of the most private hotel stays, but also incredible ocean views . The unusual destination boasts a colourful history and was even featured in the 1971 Dr Who episode, The Sea Devils, with Jon Pertwee. Built between 1867 and 1880, it was originally used to defend the coast against French invasion, and was used during both world wars to protect Portsmouth Harbour from attacks. In order to construct the impressive fort, huge blocks of granite were transported by barge to the site, and were lowered onto the seabed for its foundations. Luxury loo! The hotel has been renovated with many modern activities and facilities for guests to have a comfortable and memorable stay . Views above the atrium roof are spectacular, and guests can enjoy a meal on the roof overlooking the beautiful coast off the Isle of Wight . The thick 60ft-high concrete walls mean guests can rest easy knowing the fort can withstand any ocean waves crashing again its sides. While it would have cost about \u00a3462,500 to build when it was first created, inflation would equate to that figure being closer to \u00a343million today.

Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. \"If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,\" Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: \"Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion.\" \"Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza\" tweeted A\u10e6anda. \"Just mock them for their ignorance.\" Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. \"Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!\" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  \"Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business.\" Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. \"Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?\" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads \"bigots.\" Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. \"Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?\" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. \"Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses,\" said a tweet from Victor Nikki. \"What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob,\" tweeted Savannah. \"Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere.\" Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is \"to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith,\" according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. \"That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual,\" Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. \"You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be.\" Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

Louis van Gaal's side have beaten Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks to enhance their chances of finishing in the top four and changing what looked like a difficult first campaign for the Dutchman into a relatively successful one. After a memorable 4-2 win over local rivals and reigning champions City on Sunday, United face a stern examination at Stamford Bridge. Gary Neville believes Manchester United have a good chance of beating Chelsea with the form they're in . Neville knows United have played well in recent weeks but admits Van Gaal's system and squad will be pushed to the limit against a Chelsea side looking to move one step closer to the title. 'The tests have been Liverpool and City,' he told Press Association Sport. 'This is another test. They have proven themselves, but this is the best team in the country and to go to Stamford Bridge is the toughest test. Louis van Gaal's side have performed admirably this season and are all but guaranteed Champions League . 'The performances from United in the past month have been absolutely outstanding in any season. 'Forget the fact that in this season they are not going to win the league, in any season the level of performance they have shown in this last month has been of a hard standard.' After a stuttering start to his reign, Van Gaal has answered his critics by finding a formation that suits the players at his disposal and Neville reckons a top-four place is all but sewn up. United dispatched of  Manchester City on Sunday as they extended their league lead over their rivals . 'We were always very fixed in our formation,' the England coach said of his time at Old Trafford.

Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from. Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June. Manchester City's tenacious, \u00a0creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea) At 36 years old, he is no spring chicken, but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side. Tremmel has played second fiddle to Michel Vorm and then Lukasz Fabianski during his four years at Swansea, but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the Swans beat Bradford in the Capital One Cup final two years ago. Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel, 36, is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - Glen Johnson (Liverpool) England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool, but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer. Johnson, who has 54 England caps, is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books. England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup looks set to leave Liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - Kolo Toure (Liverpool) Another regular at Liverpool who is still to extend his contract. Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November, but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club. Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool . Centre-back - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows, especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him. Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season. At 30, he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams. Holland's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa . Left-back - Luke Garbutt (Everton) Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal, but he is yet to put pen to paper. The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere. Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he's yet to commit . Right wing - James Milner (Manchester City) Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer, Milner has 15 years' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps. Milner is both tenacious and creative, either in the centre of midfield or out wide, and he is still a year off his 30th birthday. Milner has 15 years in top flight experience, 53 England caps and still isn't 30, so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Named Arsenal captain last summer, but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury. Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return. May be 33, but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist. Mikel Arteta hasn't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin . Central midfield - Tom Cleverley (Manchester United) Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer, Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal. 'I think I'm going to be his type of player,' he said. But alas, that did not prove to be the case. The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa, where he has played 30 times. He is not wanted back at United. Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international. Unwanted by Manchester United, Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley . Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez (Newcastle) Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month, but is no longer wanted by his club. Will be 32 in the summer, but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him. Testicular cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere, even if it isn't Newcastle . Striker - Danny Ings (Burnley) One of a number of young English strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for Burnley this season. Rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United and their neighbours City, as well as David Moyes' Real Sociedad. Manchester United and City are said to be interested in Burnley's dangerous striker Danny Ings . Striker - James Wilson (Manchester United) Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under Ryan Giggs against Hull. The 19-year-old has played 16 times under Van Gaal, but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close, the United academy product is yet to agree terms.

Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women .

I like wearing fitted dresses and showing my figure off. I\u2019d love her to get something more fashionable like a bob.' Miss Bredo admits she does not fancy Prince William and is not tempted to have her own happy ending like the royal couple. She said: 'I do lots of jobs with a William lookalike, but I don\u2019t see him like that. Prince Harry's the better one. His bad boy image is more for me.' Although her counterpart is in the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London currently awaiting her second child, Miss Bredo is not keen to start a family herself. The glamorous Essex resident said: 'I've recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend so I\u2019m not thinking about babies. 'Kate\u2019s new baby isn\u2019t making me broody,' said the lookalike (with her nephew Louis).

Miss Bredo started her career after noticing her resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge. She was routinely stopped in the street when Kate first came into the public eye while dating Prince William. She said: 'I was shopping in Debenhams with my mum when this woman came running after us. 'I thought I\u2019d left something, but she just said, \"I have to tell you, you look so much after Kate Middleton.\" 'Even at the opticians having my eyes tested, the optometrist told me I looked like her. Miss Bredo (left, with her mum and sister) began her career after people kept commenting on her likeness to Kate Middleton .

My mum told me I looked like her and needed to do something with it.' Miss Bredo sent an email to a lookalike agency with her photographs in 2009.

After the royal couple\u2019s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo began working as a lookalike full-time.

'It was really strange, people wanting a picture with me, but I got into it and really had fun.' Miss Bredo studies Kate\u2019s mannerisms as well as following her beauty regime. She said: 'I have regular trims to keep my hair looking good, every two months and curl the ends the same as Kate. 'Her signature look is a lot of black eyeliner so I get through that really quickly. 'I spend \u00a330 a month buying black eyeliner. My favourite brand is Bare Minerals. She has regular trims to keep her hair in good shape, spends \u00a330 a month on black eyeliner, has regular manicures and buys clothes that are distinctly 'Kate' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George last year, Miss Bredo (middle) has had plenty of shoots with tots and has even has to wear a baby bump . 'She also wears very harsh blusher and has natural nails so I give myself regular manicures.' Miss Bredo spends hours searching for the Duchess on the internet so she can keep up-to-date with her wardrobe. She said: 'If she\u2019s wearing something new, I\u2019ll try and find it but it\u2019s usually sold out instantly. 'I know what kind of clothes she\u2019ll wear now. 'When I\u2019m going clothes shopping I\u2019ll choose some things that I think are \"Kate.\" 'I picked up this black and white spotted dress and my mum didn't think it was something the Duchess of Cambridge would wear.

Kate Middleton (pictured in London on 12 March) is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William any day now . Miss Bredo usually appears with a William lookalike and their after-work drinks get plenty of attention. She said: 'You can tell people are staring and some people take sneaky pictures of us. 'But a lot of people come up and ask to take a picture, it\u2019s funny we\u2019re just two friends having a drink.

Detectives have issued a photo of a brown haired, Caucasian male wearing a black top who they want to speak to after  a fire was started at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2.15am on  April 1. Victoria Police said: 'Detectives have released a FACE image of a man that may be able to assist with their enquiries.' Dandenong Crime Investigation Unit detectives are yet to determine the exact cause of the fire which is being treated as suspicious. The Dandenong fire was one of a string of suspected arson attacks on three Melbourne Catholic churches with links to paedophile priests. The church is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased convicted paedophile Father Kevin O'Donnell. Police have released an image of a bearded young man they want to speak to in relation to a suspected arson attack on a Catholic church in Melbourne . Emergency services were called to a fire at St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong, at 2am on Wednesday, and police are treating the blaze as suspicious . Police are investigating whether the blaze is connected to two separate suspicious blazes that were lit two days before at St James Catholic Church in Brighton and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda, where paedophile priest Ronald Pickering served as minister. St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong\u00a0is said to be the site of child sex attacks perpetrated by now-deceased Father Kevin O'Donnell . On April 1, it took firefighters 90 minutes to extinguish blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street in Dandenong. Father O'Donnell - who was reportedly known by police as the 'two-a-day man' - was jailed for 15 months in 1995 after he admitted to abusing\u00a010 boys and two girls. He is believed to have committed hundreds of sexual assaults against  young girls and boys over the 50 years that he worked in Victorian Catholic churches, before he retired in 1992. He died in 1997. At the Dandenong church in 1958 Father O'Donnell allegedly molested a 15-year-old boy in the presbytery and went on to sexually abuse his brother, sister and friends,\u00a0The Age reported. He presided over the church from 1958 to 1986, before moving onto Oakleigh. On March 30,\u00a0heritage-listed St James Catholic Church in Brighton was mostly destroyed by fire and St Mary's Catholic Church in St Kilda was found with a small amount fire damage to a door. Bishop Peter Elliott told 3AW Catholic churches would be increasing their security, and said he did not believe the fires were lit by sex abuse victims. Australian actress Rachel Griffiths said she was 'quite elated' when she heard the 124-year-old James Catholic church  had been destroyed by fire. Firefighters extinguished blazes at the altar and storage room of St Mary's Catholic Church on Foster Street . The Six Feet Under star revealed that like many of the church's former parishioners she found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east. Firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the  building at around 6.30am on Monday morning but it was left gutted. Ms Griffiths told 774 ABC Melbourne the church was plagued by 'tragedy and complicated feelings' and described it as being known locally as 'the haunted house on the hill'. 'We've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [Father Ronald] Pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in,' she said. 'It's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish, it's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes.' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at St James church in Brighton, in Melbourne's south-east . Australian actress Rachel Griffiths is happy that her former Melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it. Her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because Pickering wouldn't have a 'divorced woman in the church'. 'I think that's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends' brothers got involved with,' she said. Ronald Pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in Melbourne . 'We stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door.' At least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest Ronald Pickering between 1960 and 1980, according to research carried out in 2012. The former priest was named by the Catholic Church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children. However, after emigrating to Britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died. One victim, Raymond D'Brass, told a 2013 Victorian government inquiry that Pickering groomed him with cigarettes, money and alcohol. He was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church. In his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on March 4, 2013, Mr D'Brass said: 'Over this four-year period I am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by Father Ronald Pickering. 'I was regularly fondled and petted by Pickering, as were other boys. This occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery. I began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with Pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol, which left me vulnerable to such abuse.' Ms Griffiths revealed she and other local Catholics had avoided being married in the church . Photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . He recalled: 'I now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses, as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication. In 1983, I stopped going to the presbytery after Pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming Sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father. 'He told me that I was not welcome back and that I would burn in hell. Between 1983 and 1987, the two other boys who I know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money, alcohol and cigarettes from Pickering, but I chose not to because I was terrified of him. I have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by Pickering. 'One night after one of the boys paid a visit to Pickering, he attempted suicide. He was unsuccessful on this attempt, but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later.' Many of the church's former parishioners found it hard to even 'drive past' St James church in Brighton after revelations of child abuse came out . The church is described as a 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church' on its heritage-listed page . The cause of the fire has not yet been established. 'MFB will determine the cause of the fire and then if it's suspicious it will be passed on to police,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said. More than 80 firefighters and 20 trucks were at the scene where the ancient bluestone church was fully alight on Monday morning. A caller to radio show 3AW, named Andrew, said: 'You can hear that in the background, the roof is actually collapsing now.' 20 fire trucks were at the scene of the fire at the ancient bluestone church . Residents watching the fire were cleared from the area because of asbestos.\u00a0And a 10 metre exclusion zone was put in place around the building over fears of structural collapse. MFB spokesperson David Jarwood told the ABC the smoke could be seen from 50 kilometres away. 'It's about 50 by 40 metres apparently the blaze is, the structure, so I'm not surprised people can see a plume from Mornington,' he said. Smoke from the St James Church fire could be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge. An advice notice put out by the MFB said: 'Emergency services are attending to building fire in North Rd Brighton. The area of North Rd and St James Brighton is currently closed and people are advised to avoid the area.' Smoke from the St James Church fire can be seen across Melbourne, including the West Gate Bridge . The church was built in 1891 and the Parish of Saint James was established a year later. In 1990 a bell tower and bells were installed at a cost of $500,000. The Victorian Heritage Database website said the church 'stands on a site which has great importance in the early history of Catholicism in Victoria as the place where the mission to Brighton was established circa 1854'. It is described as 'a fine complex of Roman Catholic church, rectory and church close, mostly dating from the last century but with additions made in 1908 and in the 1920s'. It has an 'unusually elaborate 1934 decoration of the chancel with Roman mosaic flooring, opus sectile tiling and marble altars and rails. The pipe organ by Alfred Fuller of Kew, placed centrally in the rear gallery, is a rare example of his work'. Investigators are keen to speak to anyone that may have seen any suspicious activity in the area. Police are urging anyone with information about the fire to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit www.crimestoppersvic.com.au to make a confidential report.", "claim": "police have released

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "He has just been given licence to pick one of the finest backs of the era for the World Cup, but Michael Cheika is more pre-occupied with the denigration of his Wallaby pack. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau could be a glorious asset at the showpiece tournament after Australia\u2019s policy against picking players based abroad was relaxed this week, but one thing he can\u2019t do is anchor the scrum. The national coach refuses to bite back, but he has evidently noted and logged claims from these parts that his forwards will be cannon fodder for their English and Welsh rivals, amid the three-way tussle for qualification from daunting Pool A. Australia head coach Michael Cheika is aware that his pack is being written off for the World Cup . Cheika's side will face England and Wales in crunch pool games at the tournament in September . England's pack demolished Australia at scrum-time during last November's 26-17 victory at Twickenham . In fact, many of the claims have come from these pages. Speaking to Sportsmail from Sydney, Cheika repeatedly name-checked a certain knight of the realm and columnist of this newspaper, among the voices arguing that the green-and-gold pack will be smashed into submission. \u2018It has been pretty well reported here that Clive Woodward and others have said that England are going to take us apart in the forwards,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been hearing. I understand that they will have a lot of confidence in their forwards to take us on, but I think you discount the English backs at your peril, because they have some very powerful runners. In Ben Youngs, Care and Wigglesworth, they have three half-backs who will challenge the line every time. \u2018Joseph looks like a nice player and they\u2019ve got some good options in midfield now. Tuilagi will come back into it, they have Barritt too and big Sam (Burgess) might even get a run soon enough, as he grows into the game. Ford has done well for England at 10, they\u2019ve got fast wingers and I\u2019m a big fan of Mike Brown at full-back. There are a variety of threats that we will have to deal with.\u2019 Cheika\u2019s admiration for England\u2019s attacking runners behind the scrum is part of the former Leinster coach\u2019s overall assertion that the European nations are just as adept at playing an open game as their southern rivals, when conditions allow. But his repeated references to the pre-tournament dismissal of his pack suggest that there will be a strong emphasis on the set piece in particular during the World Cup countdown over the summer. Toulon playmaker Matt Giteau (left) is set to feature for the Wallabies at the World Cup . \u2018Commentators in the UK are saying we won\u2019t be able to match it with England and Wales in the forwards,\u2019 he reiterated. \u2018They\u2019re saying that it\u2019s a shame to waste the talent in our backs. There\u2019s been a fair bit of that coming out, but we\u2019re working hard to make up ground in that area. \u2018Clive Woodward \u2013 who is not just your average spectator \u2013 says we won\u2019t be able to compete with the English scrum. For us, it\u2019s about having a clear philosophy about how we want to do it then practising a lot. We will aim to be at our best in every single scrum.\u2019 According to Cheika, the epic final day of this year\u2019s Six Nations \u2013 truly \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 \u2013 gave a vivid demonstration to viewers Down Under about the threat to the Wallabies from England and Wales. \u2018Both those sides are shaping up well,\u2019 he said. \u2018England will be on home soil and the Welsh will be much closer to home than we will be. I\u2019m sure they will be fancying their chances against us. Most people are looking at us as the ones who will be in the most trouble, but we will relish it and enjoy it. \u2018England and Wales will be feeling good about themselves after the Six Nations. The performance by Wales against Italy in their final game was incredible. I was watching it until it was 13-12 and it was the wee small hours here so I went to bed. When I woke up, they had won by 50! When they needed to, they were able to do that and that is very confidence-building.\u2019 As a long-standing fan of rugby league, Cheika is well aware of Sam Burgess\u2019s potential to make a major impact in his new code, once he has come through the transition phase. He is preparing for the Bath player to be unleashed against Australia; a country where he is revered in light of his title-winning exploits for the Rabbitohs in Sydney. Cheika has cited Ben Youngs (left) and Danny Care as dangerous No 9's who challenge the advantage line .

The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress.

A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians. The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\". It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President. 'We thought it was going to happen this year. I feel like we\u2019re close \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction. ' Scroll down for video . Kim and Khloe Kardashian laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame during their April 10 visit. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend, Kim Kardashian wrote in an op-ed, 'I would like President Obama to use the word \u201cgenocide.\u201d It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President' Tricky language: President Barack Obama sent an administration official to Armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim and Khloe walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial. They were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Khloe's  Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use last week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff also said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kardashian, who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins\u00a0Kara and Kourtni\u00a0Kardashian, said, 'Now is the time to speak out, and every little bit helps' 'I will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was,' the reality television star said, encouraging Turkey to label the killings as a genocide. 'It\u2019s not the fault of the people who live there now, ' she noted, and 'I think if they recognize it and acknowledge it, everyone can move on. 'I believe in moving on and looking toward a brighter future, but you can\u2019t move on unless you acknowledge the past. To not do so is an act of disrespect.' Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . Kardashian recalled in the op-ed that her family tree would have ended if her grandparents hadn't left Armenia for Los Angeles the year before the armed conflict. 'There are so many people who lost their families, and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking\u2014they should never be forgotten,' she wrote. 'The whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. A million-and-a-half people were brutally massacred, and a country can just pretend like it never happened? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.' While in Armenia, Kardashian and her family visited the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument\u2019s eternal flame that honors those countryman who were killed in 1915. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the flame. Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a\u00a0blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it. 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip to her ancestors' homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Khloe also kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Friday  the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters, beating its goal of 200,000 names. Google did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle, however. The White House said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' It announced at the same time that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew would attend a ceremony in Armenia on Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name this year to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed.", "claim": "the reality star said it was 'very disappointing' he stopped short of using the word. he wrote in an op-ed in time magazine:' i would like president obama to use the word genocide president obama sent an administration official to armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by ottoman turks. but he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic armenians a 'genocide' for fear.", "cnndm_id": "12670e6af0ccf95cf8de50f651f0fded33d419b0", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians.", "The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office.", "Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide.", "Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word \"genocide\".", "It\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President.", "'We thought it was going to happen this year.", "I feel like we\u2019re close \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.

Goldfish are being caught weighing up to 2kg and koi carp up to 8kg and one metre in length, in the waterways of Western Australia amongst other exotic introduced species. 'A lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish, so they prey on them and compete for habitat,' Dr David Morgan, the Director of the Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research at Murdoch University, told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Goldfish (pictured) weighing up to 2kg are some of the exotic aquarium fish invading and destroying WA's waterways . Koi carp (pictured) weighing up to 8kg and up to one metre in length are another of the 13 introduced pests . The native fish in the region, such as this\u00a0Balston's Pygmy Perch which has been attacked, are only up 10cm . 'Our native fish are generally less than 10cm in length like the pygmy perch or the native minnows. 'In the south-west of Western Australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there, so the rivers are refuges for the native fish and when they are forced to coexist with introduced species, they just don't do very well.' Aside from feasting on local fish and taking their homes, introduced species are also bringing exotic parasites and disease with them. 'In Perth we're aware of a couple of parasites. One is pretty devastating on native fish, it's an anchor worm which is a little crustacean that leaves a hideous, hideous impact on native fish and was probably introduced by goldfish. A huge Murray River Cod was removed from a Perth wetland in Novemeber last year: 'A lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish, so they prey on them and compete for habitat,' Dr David Morgan, the Director of the Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research at Murdoch University, said . Pest carps: 'In the south-west of Western Australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there,' he added . 'We've now found it in three rivers around Perth and south of Perth. 'It's been only in the last decade that we've discovered a lot of parasites and disease that we don't know a lot about - there's a lot of things that have come in to Australia that we really don't know anything about.' Research conducted by Dr Morgan and Stephen Beatty found that at least 13 species of fish had been introduced into south-western Australia, with pet owners believed to be the biggest culprits. In 2012, the world's biggest ever specimen of a South American cichlid was found living in WA.

Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino says Kane deserves to win the award for his impact on English football . But Pochettino says Kane, who could become the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Gary Lineker achieved the feat 27 years ago, should take the award. 'I think that Hazard is a very good player, he's fantastic, a great player. But the impact that Harry has had on English football is massive. 'Maybe the impact is bigger than Hazard and his performances. 'Everyone knew that Hazard is a brilliant player.

It's not a pre-season tour where you spend maybe 14-15 days away. 'On a pre-season, you need good pitches for training. You have a problem with traffic like happened on the last pre-season tour.

A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you\u2019re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don\u2019t do that.'", "claim": "new york-based writer danielle page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice. the drivers have revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural tips all in the name of love. sharif, 32, said honesty is 'key' love.", "cnndm_id": "2bcfc319d2c4a8358d2fa0034027009a4368a2ae", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["New York City cab drivers spend their entire work days eavesdropping on their customers conversations, so it's no surprise that many of them have learned a thing or two about love and relationships along the way.", "With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union.", "The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango.", "A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you.", "Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice .", "'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person.", "If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle.", "Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans.", "Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become.", "'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle.", "'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.'", "A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years.", "And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings.", "When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date.", "Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy .", "New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare.", "Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'.", "'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said.", "Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success.", "But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar.", "According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'.", "And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that.", "Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf.", "'When you\u2019re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don\u2019t do that.'"], "sum_sents": ["new york-based writer danielle page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice.", "the drivers have revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural tips all in the name of love.", "sharif, 32, said honesty is 'key' love."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 2, 7]}

Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland \u2013 specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital.

Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe\u2019s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus.

It marks the end of a six-year case, after the teenagers first reported their ordeal to officials at Clatskanie Middle School in Oregon - only to be told to 'suck it up'. Josi Harrison, Laura Lefebvre, and Hailey Walden were all in eighth grade when they claim their high school-age boyfriends lured them into sending nude pictures to their phones. Ordeal: Laura Lefebvre (left) and Josi Harrison (right) are two of three girls who have won a civil claim against their school district for failing to support them after being bullied into sending naked pictures to boyfriends . Traumatic: Hailey Walden, now a straight-A student, left Clatskanie Middle School to escape the harrowing experience after the principal and local police chief said she would be charged for the distribution of photos . After sending one, they were blackmailed into sending more. However, when they sought help from the principal and Clatskanie District police chief, they were told they would be charged with creating and distributing child pornography. On Thursday, two years after filing a civil suit against Clatskanie School District, a judge has ordered that each girl receive $75,000 in damages. All three girls have subsequently moved to new schools. Speaking in December 2013, Hailey Walden told\u00a0KATU: 'We had grown up with each other and he was always the popular cool guy that everyone wanted to date. I was 13, I didn't know. I thought that if I sent him the picture he would think I'm pretty and love me.' In total, she sent him 30 pictures, which then swept the school. However, her mother Billi Leinonen told the station, principal Jeff Baughman and police chief Marvin Hoover 'chuckled' when they brought the case to them. Hoover, she says, started reading Hailey her Miranda rights and said she would be charged. Though no charges were filed against Hailey, she claims the meeting exacerbated her trauma. On Thursday Clatskanie School District, which encapsulates CMHS, was ordered to pay $225,000 to the girls . Josi Harrison and Laura Lefebvre reported similar conflicts with school officials. Along with Hailey, they filed a $2.5 million federal suit against the district in 2013. The judge ordered a reduced payment on the grounds that the school has taken commendable steps to ensure the situation is not repeated. An attorney for one of the girls, Amber Lunsford, told Oregon Live: 'This suit was never about the money. It was about effecting change.' She added: 'Each of the girls accomplished what they wanted.' Reacting to the settlement on Thursday, Josi told\u00a0Fox 12 Oregon: 'I feel like it made me have to fight battles I shouldn\u2019t have to fight, especially at such a young age, but I feel it made me stronger.'

But experts have warned the disease is not the only health danger associated with the pursuit of an artificial year-round tan. Those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes. Dermatologist\u00a0Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpes . Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up. Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns the virus, and other bacteria, can survive on tanning beds, despite the heat. 'In my practice, I've seen acquired bacterial infections, warts, and herpes infections from tanning beds,' she told Yahoo. She said staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause skin infections, faecal bacteria, the herpes virus and the wart-causing human papillomavirus are all able to withstand the heat of a sunbed to survive. Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down. The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive. When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses. It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware. 'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned. 'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.' Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex. Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes. A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system. Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users . Symptoms of genital herpes include: . These symptoms may last up to 20 days, but the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring. Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up, the virus remains dormant.

During the drunken attack, which was caught on CCTV, Scots Guard Shaun Smith, 25, can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim\u2019s head. His fellow soldier, Welsh Guard Jason Collins, 22, rained blows with his fists on to the man\u2019s body. Scroll down for video . CCTV cameras captured the horrifying attack last April in which soldiers Shaun Smith (left, in black jeans) and Jason Collins (right, bending over), kicked and punched two men repeatedly near their barracks . Collins, 22, (right) has been stationed at Buckingham Palace since the attack. Smith (left), was described as an 'angel' in court by his officer . The soldiers were expected to be jailed for the \u2018deeply unpleasant and inexcusable\u2019 assault. But yesterday a judge at Teesside Crown Court made what even he admitted was an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 decision to let the men walk free. Judge James Hill, QC, said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them. \u2018I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope, as your commanding officers have expressed, that the Army feels able to keep you.\u2019 The furious victim James Wormald \u2013 who was left with the imprint of Smith\u2019s shoe on his forehead \u2013 said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened. \u2018There was absolutely no reason for the attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong. With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck, Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them. A judge rejected their version of events, saying the man seen in the footage (above) posed 'no threat' when they were beating him . \u2018I don\u2019t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries, the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it.\u2019 Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm. Smith was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work. Collins was given a 12-month community order, and both men were each told to pay \u00a31,000 compensation. The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service's sentencing guidelines. With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each, the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years. Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as 'exceptional'. In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised. Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended, while Collins received a 12-month community order. The pair launched the vicious attack after a night\u2019s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April. They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots. They encountered local men Mr Wormald, 25, and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words. Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them \u2013 a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald, a chef. The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald. Their victim runs across a road, trips and falls. Smith, who has a hood covering his face, can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim\u2019s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald\u2019s body. The pair then ran off and hid in a stream, but were caught by the police. Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face. Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James\u2019s Palace since the incident. He is likely to keep his job.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will \"fix\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved. The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm. In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion. Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption. Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need. These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community. Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential. Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences. To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief. Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful. RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves. A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real \"crossroads of America.\" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work.", "claim": "frida ghitis: indiana's religious freedom law will not discriminate against gays and lesbians. he says liberty and equality can discriminate against the lgbt community. he says we need to fix indiana's discrimination against lgbt community.", "cnndm_id": "3ad0320476e8dda3a00604efdcf766e91766c815", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately.", "After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others, a recent study claimed . The implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding, it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders. This is because the genes that make up the people who we are, and the environments in which we are raised cannot be considered independently of each other. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right)\u00a0raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . The research analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. It found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population. In seeking to explain this connection, the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors. This can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together. On the other hand, their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases, with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members. Genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation (46 per cent) than for adult rape (19 per cent). While the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending, it cannot of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved. Dr Mairi Levitt says that\u00a0genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . Putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents. Of course genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment. As can be seen from the percentages above, the largest proportion of cases involved a large, rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour. You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in V\u00e4stmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of saliva from which the researchers extracted DNA. One of the genes examined was Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). This gene is a key enzyme which breaks down and releases energy in brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. The transmitter be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness . 'About 25 per cent of Caucasian men carry the less active variant of MAOA,' explained Professor Sheilagh Hodgins, a researcher at the University of Montreal. 'Among them, those who experience physical abuse in childhood are more likely than those who are not abused to display serious anti-social behaviour from childhood through adulthood.' Separating  nature and nurture may be useful as a model but does not really make sense because research has demonstrated that gene development is affected by the environment. Any report of genes influencing behaviour tends to polarise opinion. Some may welcome the science and see this as confirmation that sex offenders are biologically different from other people and could perhaps be prevented from offending. Others will be concerned about the stigmatisation of family members defined as 'at risk', but still unlikely to offend themselves. Only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at-risk families would mainly target the innocent. So what then might this mean in practical terms? The discovery could perhaps one day lead to the identification of specific genotypes but could or should this affect the way we deal with sex offenders? A genotype has already been identified that increases the risk of violent behaviour in specific environments. Dubbed the 'criminal' or 'warrior' gene, it has in some cases even been used successfully by defence teams in mitigation pleas to avoid the death penalty in the US, or reduce the length of sentences in the US and Italy. It might be thought odd that a convicted murderer, who is at increased risk of offending and therefore presumably more dangerous to the public in the future, would be treated more leniently. Sex offenders, particularly where children are involved, are probably even more stigmatised than other violent criminals so perhaps a genetic defence would not work in their favour. What is clear is that finding genetic influences on behaviour does not affect legal responsibility. It is recognised that there are many genetic, biological and environmental factors that influence behaviour, and it may be harder for all sorts of reasons for some people to refrain from criminal acts than others. Any research that helps us to understand problem behaviours is to be welcomed, but the headline figure \u2013 a genetic link in 40 per cent of cases \u2013 does not tell us that sex offenders 'can't help it' or are different from 'normal' people.

behaviour.", "You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour.", "This is according to a recent study

The visit, which kicked off with a pageant aboard a flotilla of boats on the local canal, was part of Willem-Alexander's 48th birthday celebrations. Koningsdag - or King's Day - is a public holiday in the Netherlands and is traditionally marked with a royal procession either in the capital Amsterdam or in one of the country's major cities. Happy family: The Dutch royals celebrated King Willem-Alexander's birthday in Dordrecht . Warm welcome: The Dutch royal couple were all smiles as they meet well-wishers in the trading city . Today, it was the turn of Dordrecht, a city in the south-west of the country, which was once a major trading port, as well as a military hub. Signs of its martial past were thin on the ground today, however, with the streets filled with a sea of joyful humanity, most of whom cheered and waved as the royals floated past. Taking centre stage was Argentina-born Queen Maxima, who opted for a typically eye-catching ensemble of a raspberry pink coat and hat enlivened with a pair of chunky crystal earrings. Also aboard the royal barge, the Dordtevaar, were the couple's three daughters:\u00a0Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange, 11, Princess Alexia, nine, and Princess Ariane, eight. Willem-Alexander's brother Prince Constantijn, 45, was also aboard, as was his 48-year-old wife, Princess Laurentien, who opted for a tailored dress in patriotic bright orange. Is that it? Eldest daughter Princess Catharina-Amalia, 11, cuddles up to her mother during the event . Round of applause: The Queen and the princesses join in with a round of applause for Willem-Alexander . Big arrival: The couple and their three daughters travelled through the city by barge . Family affair: \u00a0The couple was joined by Prince\u00a0Constantijn and his wife Laurentien who wore bright orange . Looking good: Maxima looked wonderful in her summery raspberry pink get-up . Matching: The Dutch queen completed her look with a slick of bright pink lipstick and chunky earrings . All smiles: The 43-year-old appeared to be enjoying the occasion and smiled brightly throughout . Echoing their parents and uncle, all three girls smiled and waved at the crowds, most of whom seemed to be enjoying the bright spring sunshine while watching the procession go past. Others used the royal day off to make some extra money, with one enterprising soul setting up a stand that offered selfies with cardboard versions of the Dutch royals for \u20ac1 apiece. Koningsdag is a long-standing Dutch tradition that began in 1890 with Queen Wilhelmina who celebrated her birthday on the 31st August. When her daughter Juliana became Queen, the date was moved to the 30th April - a tradition maintained by her daughter Beatrix, even though her real birthday is the 31st January. Since April 2013, when Willem-Alexander took the throne following his mother's abdication, the holiday has taken place his birthday, the 27th April. The celebrations, which kick off the night before with King's Parties, also include vrijmarkts - flea markets - in most towns and mass consumption of a delicious orange pastry called the tompouce. A right royal selfie! A well-wisher snaps a selfie with the Dutch King and Queen . Royal wave: King Willem-Alexander waves at the crowds during a walk through the city with his children .

Winning the sweepstake was nice but three points was the main thing.\u2019 Leicester have appeared doomed to relegation for months, cemented to the bottom of the table since November.

But two successive wins give genuine hope of survival with seven games to play, five at home. Vardy struck a confident tone. Survival is, after all, in Leicester\u2019s hands. \u2018We\u2019ve all been running ourselves in the ground and not getting the points we deserve,\u2019 said Vardy. \u2018We\u2019ve not played bad in any game really.

Leicester switched to a 3-5-2 formation and flooded men forwards in a bid to add to David Nugent\u2019s strike. Robert Huth found a leveller with 10 minutes to go before Vardy ran from halfway to drill a cracking finish in the first minute of injury time.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "Caledonia, Michigan (CNN)Ben and Shelby Offrink met in college. It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. \"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,\" said Ben with a smile. \"He was sneaky,\" says Shelby. \"Yeah, I wanted to meet her,\" says Ben, \"and that was the best way I could figure out.\" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says. She breaks into tears: \"Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't.\"", "claim": "ben and shelby offrink are

Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.'

There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065.

Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video . Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday . But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday . Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday . Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day .

The Denmark international was due to start the match but ended up being dropped from the entire squad after his poor timekeeping landed him in hot water with manager\u00a0Dieter Hecking. The Wolfsburg boss probably didn't need an invitation to lose his temper after watching his side crumble to a 4-1 home defeat by Napoli in the Europa League on Thursday and was obviously angered when Bendtner rolled up late the next day. Nicklas Bendtner was dropped from the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday's game after arriving late for training . Manager Dieter Hecking said that Bendtner would have started the match if he hadn't turned up late . 'Nicklas was going to play from the beginning but our training session was clearly earlier than he thought,' said boss Hecking. Sporting director Klaus Allofs added: 'There are a lot of ways of finding out when training is. And it is not as if there is that much traffic in Wolfsburg.' Hecking, speaking to Danish newspaper BT, said: 'As a team we have some rules that everyone should keep. When you break those rules you have to take the consequences.

Amedy Coulibaly stormed into the Hyper Cacher Jewish store, killing four and taking others captive before being shot dead in a hail of gunfire by French special forces. The heavily televised events in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Patrick Klugman, a lawyer representing the six survivors, said images broadcast from Hyper Cacher on January 9 'lacked the most basic precautions' and endangered those still alive inside.

Six hostages who hid in a  freezer during the Islamist attacks have sued French media for broadcasting their location live . Terrorist: Amedy Coulibaly slaughtered customers during the siege at the Hyper Cacher store. Lawyers claim French media endangered the lives of hostages hiding a freezer by revealing their location live on air . He singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV which revealed live on air that the group - including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby - was hiding  in the freezer. They had been taken to the cold room by one of the supermarket's employees. 'The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime,' Mr Klugman told AFP Thursday, roundly criticising coverage by other outlets of the movements by security forces during the standoff. The lives of those hiding 'could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting,' Klugman said. He added that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists. The lawsuit charges media  with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a \u20ac15,000 (\u00a311,000) fine.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans. Their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs. Over half, 54 per cent, also confessed they did not know that Lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites, affects their pets as well as themselves. Knowledge about Lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives. In extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases - such as Lyme disease - to humans . At the other extreme, symptoms may be so mild that someone who's been bitten by an infected tick may experience only flu-like symptoms. Ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans. Areas of undergrowth (including parks and gardens - as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife. It's why most people are bitten below the waist. With the forecast of increasingly damp winters and hotter summers - ideal conditions for the ticks to thrive - as well as growth in deer numbers, the concern is that the incidence of Lyme disease will rise further. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of Europe and North America. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease which can infect humans . Many people with early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around 3 to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans. Some people with Lyme disease also experience flu-like symptoms in the early stages, such as tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, joint pain,headaches, a high temperature (fever), chills and neck stiffness. More serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on. These can include: . Some of these problems will get better slowly with treatment, although they can persist if treatment is started late. A few people with Lyme disease go on to develop long-term symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. This is known as post-infectious Lyme disease. Source: NHS Choices . The increase in incidence of illnesses such as Lyme is 'a serious' cause for concern and 'ticks will become a very serious public health issue in the UK as a result of climate change', claims Julie Barratt, the director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health. She thinks we need to take a similar approach to avoiding tick-borne disease as we do to sun exposure - covering up and using insect repellent as we would sunscreen. This means taking precautions 'in the great outdoors, whether you're camping, walking in the countryside or in your back garden', she says. Concerned vets across the UK are now urging people to get their dogs checked out for the pests. Any ticks collected by vet practices will be sent to a team of scientists who will examine them for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Professor Richard Wall, from the University of Bristol, will be part of a team studying the ticks, and says their numbers have soared in the last 10 years. He said: 'Current evidence suggests that many tick-borne diseases in northern Europe are increasing in prevalence as a result of factors.' He explained this is due to changes in their habitat, increasing pet travel and climate change. He added: 'Warmer and wetter winters and milder wetter summers, in particular, may allow the normal highly seasonal pattern of tick activity to be extended, giving more continuous periods of exposure. 'In Great Britain the distribution of ticks is estimated to have expanded in the last 10 years by 17 per cent and the abundance of ticks to have increased at 73 per cent of locations surveyed.' Many people do not realise it is possible to catch Lyme disease in Britain. Joanne Drayson, from Guildford, who contracted the illness after being bitten by an infected tick while walking her dog, did not know it was possible to catch it in the UK. She said: 'I was aware of the disease but always thought it was something that was unique to the United States. 'After a long course of antibiotics, I gradually recovered my health. I still enjoy walking in the woods but now I go more prepared. 'It is important to cover up, tuck your trousers in your socks, have long sleeves and when you leave the woodland or countryside to always check for any ticks.' Public Health England estimates the number of new Lyme disease cases each year at around 3,000, while charities say the figure is closer to 15,000. In spite of this, the majority of people are still unaware that the potentially debilitating condition also affects dogs. Lyme disease is caused by a bite from an infected tick. Dogs can become bitten during walks in wooded areas or parkland in both urban and rural areas. Symptoms in dogs include lameness, lethargy and fever, which, if left untreated, can lead to more serious conditions such as kidney disease and heart failure. Many cases of Lyme disease are likely to go unnoticed by owners as they are only detected by a thorough examination. Throughout spring and early summer when ticks are most actives, vets taking part in The Big Tick Project, will be giving dogs visiting their practice a tick check. Ticks collected will be sent off for scientific analysis where they will be examined for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The Big Tick Project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham who wants to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with Lyme disease . The project is being launched by TV presenter Chris Packham and aims to raise awareness of the risks and symptoms associated with the tick-borne disease. He said: 'Research suggests that ticks are a growing problem whether that's urban parkland to woodland and open country. 'Living as I do in the New Forest where ticks can be a problem and present a real threat to my dogs, this project is close to my heart and could be important in advancing both for canine and human health. 'I know people who have contracted the disease and I cannot begin to imagine how I would feel if my dogs were to catch it too. 'While I find ticks interesting creatures, I don't want them on my dogs, in my house or on me. 'If like me, you love your dogs, you'll want the best advice and treatment to help reduce the risks associated with ticks and tick-borne disease. 'I know I can get this by talking to a vet with access to the latest innovative and effective products available to help tackle this issue.'", "claim": "knowledge about lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives. vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks. over half, 54 per cent confessed they did not know that lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites affects their pets as well as themselves.", "cnndm_id": "63265840c7cbe533e11cce335ef03727af611af3", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases to humans.", "Their warning comes after a survey found almost half of dog owners did not know that ticks can transmit deadly diseases to both humans and other dogs.", "Over half, 54 per cent, also confessed they did not know that Lyme disease, a potentially fatal illness caught from tick bites, affects their pets as well as themselves.", "Knowledge about Lyme disease is increasing and it is known to wreck lives.", "In extreme cases, the nervous system, joints and heart can be affected, and symptoms may be misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.", "Vets are urging the public to get their dogs checked out for ticks, which can spread potentially fatal diseases -

The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening \u00a3800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . \u2022 Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . \u2022 The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . \u2022 Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . \u2022 The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . \u2022 Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . \u2022 The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres \u2013 on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for \u00a380m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

Police have since told the family that the mother-of-two made a 999 call from her mobile just after she returned from the pub, which went through to BT to deal with. Operators at the telecommunications company connects both mobile and landline numbers with the requested emergency service and follow strict protocol. But when Ms Catherall called on September 13, last year, the call handler said they could not hear anything and therefore did not connect the call to the police or send help.

Mrs Keir said: 'When we found out Karen had been murdered our whole world fell apart.

'It left us feeling sick to the stomach, devastated and fuming, knowing no one was there for Karen when she needed help. 'If they had got to her in time Karen might still be alive.

Police confirmed a 999 call was made from her mobile phone to BT  at around 7pm but it was disconnected after around 13 seconds and officers were not informed. Glenys Kier and her partner Esmor Evans leaving Mold Crown Court following the trial of their daughter's killer, Darren Jeffreys . The phone call was later enhanced by detectives, who discovered arguing could be heard in the background. Ms Catherall's family are calling on BT to review their procedures, and answer questions about the call. Mrs Keir said: 'Apparently the person who picked up believed there was silence at the end of the line. They must have assumed 999 had been dialled accidentally. 'It doesn't bear thinking about what might have happened if BT had connected the call to the police.' Ms Catherall's sister, Mrs Humphreys, a catering supervisor, added: 'You regularly hear of toddlers playing with their mum's mobile phone and ringing the emergency services by mistake. 'In those instances, the police often seem to trace the call and turn up on the doorstep. 'We want to know why that didn't happen when in this situation Karen so desperately needed their help. 'We know the police aren't to blame as they never received the call, but BT should be looking into this and reviewing their policies. 'The call might have been muffled or quiet at the other end of the line, but surely it's better to put it through to the police so they can send an officer and be safe rather than sorry. 'Who knows what the outcome might have been if they had reached her in time? We don't want any other families to lose a loved one and go through the pain we have.' A BT spokesman said: 'North Wales Police contacted BT on September 24, 2014 about whether we received an emergency call from a mobile phone number and we provided them with full details including a call recording. 'Our records show that we received the call at approximately 19.07 on September 13, 2014. 'There was no response to our operator's questioning and our operator heard nothing to indicate there was any problem before the caller ended the call after about 13 seconds. 'Police forces have requested that we do not connect such calls to them and our operator correctly followed the call handling process requested by the police.' Ms Catherall's family (pictured outside court) are calling on BT to review their procedures following the call . The 999 emergency number was set up in London in June 1937 after five women were killed in a fire. A committee discussed how telephone operators could identify emergency calls and the easy to remember 999 number was born. It was later rolled out in Glasgow and extended to all major towns and cities by 1948. Since then it has expanded massively with an average of 597,000 calls a week across the UK. BT operators answer the initial call from both landlines and mobiles and find out which emergency service is required before connecting the caller. The handler has to quickly establish whether the call is genuine before transferring them. In instances where they are met with silence they ask the caller to respond by either making a noise or coughing. This can narrow down the number of accidental or prank calls made, which account for about half of the 31 million calls made annually. Of the remaining 15.5million, 52 per cent go to police, 41 per cent to ambulance service, six per cent for fire and one per cent to the coastguard and cave and mountain rescue services. The spokesman also explained that in cases where they get no response from the caller, the operator will ask whether they can make a noise or cough. In this instance Ms Catherall apparently made no response and the phone call was terminated. Detective Inspector Mark Hughes, senior investigating officer at North Wales Police, confirmed the call. He said: 'During the early evening of September 13, 2014, a 999 call was made from the mobile phone of Karen Catherall. 'The phone call was received by the telephone company operator and managed in accordance with their policy but not directed onto North Wales Police, nor in fact any police force. 'I understand the circumstances surrounding the management of this phone call are now being reviewed by the Telephone Company following a request by Karen's family.'

Yaya Toure grabbed one back for the visitors, but it wasn't enough to stop City from losing further ground on league leaders Chelsea. Here, SportsMail's\u00a0Sami Mokbel takes us through the key moments of the match. Thought Manchester City players didn't crowd referees, Manuel?

Charlene Bishop, who is 17 months old, went to feed her pony Taffee on Wednesday and was worried when she didn't meet her at the gate as normal. Her mother Danielle Flisher went to investigate and found the Shetland lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries. Sickening: Taffee the Shetland pony was\u00a0battered to death with a breeze block in the middle of the night in a brutal attack . The left side of Taffee's (left) skull was completely caved in, her left eye was battered outs of its socket and concrete was embedded in her brain . The left side of the pony's skull was completely caved in, her left eye was battered out of its socket and concrete was embedded in her brain. The five-year-old animal also had a broken leg and vets called to the field in Boxley, near Gillingham, Kent, had no option but to put the distressed pony down. Police believe Taffee was battered round the head with a breeze block sometime between 11pm on Tuesday night and 9am on Wednesday morning. Charlene, who had only owned 22in\u00a0Taffee for three months, visited her every day to groom and feed her and rode her every weekend. Ms Flisher, 19, said: 'I don't understand how anybody could be so sick. 'Taffee was a tiny pony. The vet said she was hit over and over again and it looks like by was more than one person. 'It seems they held her head collar while they beat her. Taffee was crying blood from the damage they did to her skull. Vile: The Shetland was found lying on the floor and dying from horrific head injuries after the brutal attack . 'We got Taffee for Charlene when she was diagnosed with epilepsy. She can't do the same things as everyone else, but she loved spending time with me at the yard and had Taffee to keep her happy. 'They weren't together long but they were amazing. Charlene would climb all over her and Taffee wouldn't mind. 'Charlene would even sometimes tell Taffee off and the pony would go and stand in the corner of the stable like a naughty child. 'She's lost her best friend and she's devastated.' Taffee had a foal, 10-month-old Biscuit, who the family are now in the process of finding a surrogate mother for.

'They would have seen she belonged to a child, she even had a Frozen rug on. 'Charlene doesn't understand death. She saw that Taffee was bleeding but when she woke up this morning she just assumed she was better and asked to go and feed her. It's heartbreaking, we don't know what to do.'

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "English cricket\u2019s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director. Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body\u2019s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England\u2019s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just \u2018too accident prone\u2019. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him \u2018the outstanding coach of his generation\u2019. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. \u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019 Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. \u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019 Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen\u2019s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to \u2018create a culture\u2019 in which captain Alastair Cook had \u2018the full support of all players\u2019.

The\u00a0Conservatives yesterday returned a donation of \u00a350,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But last night it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. The revelation by the Independent newspaper will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe. Last week his party's manifesto pledged to raise \u00a35 billion from clamping down on tax avoidance during the next Parliament. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans. Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.' Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than \u00a350,000 to the Conservatives. She and her husband were close friends of Margaret Thatcher and were guests of the Reagans at the White House. In his memoirs, her husband said he only pleaded guilty to get the US authorities to leave his family in peace. The revelation  will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe . He wrote: 'It was galling to listen to these vast sums of money being referred to as though they were merely numbers and to the fact that I had agreed to hand all this money to the US Government. 'But the future peace and security of the family which this agreement would secure meant that I could see advantage in what I was about to do. But that did not make it right.' A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Tollman told the Independent: 'In so far as Mrs Tollman is concerned you will see she is of good character and was acquitted of all charges.' Responding to Mr Tollman's guilty plea, a spokesman said: 'Stanley Tollman admitted to having failed to report on his US tax return two bank accounts situated outside the US. It was that omission for which he was sentenced to one day's unsupervised probation. 'The reality is that the financial settlement was the only means through which his family were going to be able to get on and lead their lives without being coerced by the Americans.'", "claim": "beatrice tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of # 20,000 to the tories earlier this month. she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. mr tollman repaid more than 100 million us dollars to america.", "cnndm_id": "7408e6418b4629220489452532a4ab98ced1d614", "annotations": [1], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers .", "The\u00a0Conservatives yesterday returned a donation of \u00a350,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges.", "Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of \u00a320,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers.", "But last night it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge.", "However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion.", "Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands.", "The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty.", "The revelation by the Independent newspaper will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe.", "Last week his party's manifesto pledged to raise \u00a35 billion from clamping down on tax avoidance during the next Parliament.", "A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans.", "Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.'", "Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than \u00a350,000 to the Conservatives.", "She and her husband were close friends of Margaret Thatcher and were guests of the Reagans at the White House.", "In his memoirs, her husband said he only pleaded guilty to get the US authorities to leave his family in peace.", "The revelation  will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe .", "He wrote: 'It was galling to listen to these vast sums of money being referred to as though they were merely numbers and to the fact that I had agreed to hand all this money to the US Government.", "'But the future peace and security of the family which this agreement would secure meant that I could see advantage in what I was about to do.", "But that did not make it right.'", "A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Tollman told the Independent: 'In so far as Mrs Tollman is concerned you will see she is of good character and was acquitted of all charges.'", "Responding to Mr Tollman's guilty plea, a spokesman said: 'Stanley Tollman admitted to having failed to report on his US tax return two bank accounts situated outside the US.", "It was that omission for which he was sentenced to one day's unsupervised probation.", "'The reality is that the financial settlement was the only means through which his family were going to be able to get on and lead their lives without being coerced by the Americans.'"], "sum_sents": ["beatrice tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of # 20,000 to the tories earlier this month.", "she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge.", "mr tollman repaid more than 100 million us dollars to america."], "rel_index": [0, 3, 5]}

The unusual video sparked a diplomatic incident, with the Costa Rican government and Ambassador to Ecuador complaining to the authorities and resulting in Ecuador issuing an apology. The creative project was executed by the Ecuadorean airline Tame, Ecuador's Tourism Ministry and Ministry of Transport and Public Works. But the stunt sparked outrage from the Costa Rican Tourism Institute, the presidential palace and the Foreign Ministry. As Ecuador residents arrived, not in Costa Rica but another Ecuador airport, Tena, where they were given fake stamps in their passports as they went through a staged passport control. No attention to detail was spared as huge posters were placed over the welcome billboards at the airport. Adverts depicting Imperial beer and 'Esencial Costa Rica,' Costa Rica's national brand,  were displayed in the airport to throw the group off the scent. Even fictitious immigration documents and car licence plates were created to make the group think they were in Golfito, a port town in Costa Rica. On top of all that organisers used mobile phone and GPS blockers to keep passengers from using technology to discover the hoax. The Tame airline staged the prank in a bid to demonstrate that Ecuador should be considered a top tourist destination . A fake passport control was set up, which even gave out fake stamps for passports . The unsuspecting tourists took part in a number of exciting activities, from white water rafting to hiking . The prank was captured by video but following complaints, the tourism organisers in Ecuador took the video down. 'We're unhappy about their use of our country to trick their people into getting to know their own country,' Costa Rican tourism minister Wilhelm von Breymann told The Tico Times.

Although they were previously considering legal action, they have since accepted the apology, La Naci\u00f3n reported. Costa Rican outlet La Naci\u00f3n uploaded it on YouTube where it has been viewed by 60,000 people.

He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook\u00a0page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story. Traffic stop: In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Mr Stack recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in South Carolina. He says he was given a warning after doing everything the cop said . Praise: Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented (above) on Mr Stack's selfie-style video, with many praising him for his honesty amid a national scandal over alleged police brutality . Mixed opinion: Although many of the users' comments were positive, others were negative (as seen bottom) 'The point of this is to say that I am an African-American male, this gentleman was Caucasian. There were no problems. He did his job, I did what I was supposed to do, and that was it,' he says. 'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?' Mr Stack captured the video just days after North Charleston officer Michael Slager was arrested for murder for allegedly shooting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away. Serviceman: 'I feel like people need to understand... not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims,' says Mr Stack (pictured left and right) Scene: Mr Stack was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse (above) when he was pulled over by the cop . He told WIS that although he had concerns over the use of force  applied by Officer Slager, 33, he was keeping an open mind about the shooting - and did not believe Scott should have tried to flee. Speaking to the station, Mr Stack, who recently completed a deployment with the National Guard and is now job hunting, said: ' It's possible for African Americans and police officers to get along. 'And, not everybody shares the same mindset because nobody's the same, everybody's different.'

The 19-year-old defied doctors' expectations after she was diagnosed with a rare form of inoperable brain cancer just after her 18th birthday. She was told she would not live past December but died four months later this month after playing with her college team at Mount St Joseph University in Cincinnati to raise $1.5million for research into childhood cancer. Scroll down for video . The casket of  basketball player Lauren Hill was placed at the site where she made her first basket five months ago, before she died of an inoperable brain tumour this month. Her high school team mates gathered to remember her at a memorial today in the arena where she scored her first basket for her college team . Today mourners at the arena celebrated her life and determination in the face of the obstacles she overcame in her short life. Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma after she became dizzy following a basketball game with\u00a0her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The tumour is found on the brain stem and can cause double vision and difficulty controlling facial expressions. Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December.\u00a0The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James\u00a0posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:\" What am I doing with my life?\" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. \"How can I be a better person?\" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial .

She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's\u00a066-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 \u2014 her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs \u2014 Katy Perry's 'Roar' \u2014 was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million \u2014 matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati .

A campaign video sees Dr Vivek Murthy and the Sesame Street favourite go through the process of getting vaccinated and explaining to children (and parents) why it is so important. In what appears to be a direct response to anti-vaccination campaigners, Elmo and Dr Murthy questions why everybody does not get a shot. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Elmo explain why getting vaccinated is crucial to keep other children safe and healthy . As Dr Murthy visits Sesame Street, Elmo tells him he is 'worried about getting a shot,' asking the Surgeon General: 'Why does everyone need a vaccination, anyway?' In response Dr Murthy compares getting vaccinated to using an umbrella when it rains and wearing a helmet on a bike. This calms Elmo who gets the shot he needs, and after realising how quick and painless it is to get a shot, he asks Dr Murthy whey everybody doesn't get a vaccination? 'That's a good question, Elmo,' Murthy says, looking at the camera. 'That's a good question.' The video, produced by the Daily Dot, is accompanied by a shorter 30-second video of Elmo and the Surgeon General released by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The campaign videos have been released in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December, sickened 147 people in the U.S., which has seen the debate over vaccination flare up. Officials at the California Department of Public Health said no new infections have been reported for the past 42 days \u2014 or two incubation periods \u2014 meaning the outbreak is over in the U.S. Many who fell ill in the Disneyland episode were not immunized against measles. Some cited personal reasons for refusing shots, and others were too young to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. In California, where 131 of the 147 measles cases could be found, a vaccination bill has generated intense debates pitting personal rights against public health. The campaign videos have been released amidst debate across the United States over whether vaccines should be compulsory in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December . The measure would bar parents from seeking vaccine exemptions for their children because of religious or personal beliefs, joining California with Mississippi and West Virginia in such strict requirements. Medical waivers would only be available for children with health problems, forcing unvaccinated children to be homeschooled. California lawmakers were set to vote on the bill last week, but this was postponed by supporters postponed so authors could work on revisions to address concerns raised in the Senate Education Committee.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today. The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon\u00a0that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government. An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow.\u00a0Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ding-dong: Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming \u2014 the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers. But Comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions. 'Washington's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company,' wrote analyst Craig Moffett in a client email.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Not only does Gareth Bale definitely want to stay at Real Madrid beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world. Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United . Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters . Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final . He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday . The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes . The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey . The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season . He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas . De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea . De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318million . All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him.

Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember\u2026 Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.' Another post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil and held in a cellar for . Mr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.' Ms Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for \u00a3249,950 in 2007 in North London. Last night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks. A spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011.

So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area. The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families. And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California. The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m. Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes. One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families. The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments. Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there. However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation. 'He said \"we've got enough millionaires here. What we need is some houses for regular working people\",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS. Scrapped: This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled . Idyllic: The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families . Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, \"if I\u2019m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?\"' It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy. In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "The little girl who broke millions of hearts after surrendering to a camera she mistook for a gun is now in the clutches of Al Qaeda, the MailOnline can exclusively reveal. Four-year-old Hudea was pictured late last year by photographer Osman Sagirli in Atmeh refugee camp, just 10km from the border with Turkey. She, her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the Syrian camp since Hudea's father was killed in the 2012 Hama massacre. But two weeks ago, the family took a fateful decision to move south, towards the city of Idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of Al Qaeda's brutal Syrian affiliate at the weekend. It means, once more, the family are in danger of becoming victims of a battle between the regime and rebels which has killed 220,000 since 2011 - 10,000 of whom were children. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Taken at the Atmeh refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey, the image shows four-year-old Hudea frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed . Hudea and her family left the camp two weeks ago; it is thought they headed for Idlib - now in the control of Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra. Pictured: An Al-Nusra fighter holds his group flag  in front of Idlib's governor building . Sharia law: Al-Nusra have promised to bring in Sharia law in the city, and have already started burning things considered banned under Islam - like these cigarettes . The Nusra Front-led rebels is set impose Sharia law on the city, which is only the second state capital to fall from the grip of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. 'We salute the people of Idlib and their stand with their sons, the Mujahideen, ... and God willing they will enjoy the justice of sharia, which will preserve their religion and their blood,' said Abu Mohamad al-Golani, Nusra Front's leader, in a recording released on Wednesday. This is horrifying news for those living under the Nusra Front. The group\u00a0group has a reputation for violence which is only rivaled by the horrors seen in ISIS-controlled territory. Charlie Winter, of the Qilliam Foundation, warned: 'Jabhat al-Nusra is an outspoken al-Qaeda affiliate. It espouses a severe interpretation of Islam and sharia law. 'They have been known to execute women who are allegedly running brothels, and stone adulterers. It is a violent interpretation of sharia law.' Indeed, the group appears to be all but following in the footsteps of ISIS, who have terrified the world with an onslaught of violence, including throwing people from the tops of buildings and getting small children to shoot so-called spies dead. Worringly, the Nusra Front - who reiterated their allegiance to Al Qaeda in the last month - have said they want to create their own 'Islamic state'. The group is known for its use of suicide bombers as it tries to achieve its goal, and has claimed\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for\u00a0mass executions, murdered journalists and even priests in the past few years. In the days since they took control of Idlib, there have been reports of two Christian men being executed, while the Vatican - citing local news sources - claimed a Greek Orthodox priest had been kidnapped by jihadists. Fight: The city fell after a four day battle which saw fighters on both sides lose their lives . Flee: It is thought about 15,000 people ran from the city as the Nusra Front approached . Trauma: Save the Children reports many of the children were traumatised by what they had seen . For a child like Hudea, who has clearly already been left horribly traumatised by a war which has been raging her entire life, life under the strict sharia law is likely to be nothing be more terrifying. But life is no better under the Syrian regime: indeed, it is al-Assad's fighters who were said to be behind the Hama massacre in which she lost her father. Pro-government militia killed at least 55 people that day, going from house to house, murdering men, women and children. It was after this the family fled north, to the camp near the border with Turkey, which has grown to become a home to 30,000 refugees. But despite being so close to the safety of Turkey, the family appear to have never made it across. Instead, for reasons unknown to MailOnline's source within the camp, they decided to leave the camp - venturing out into territory which has changed hands between the different rebel factions and the al-Assad regime numerous times over the last four years. The MailOnline's source within the camp said: 'The child does not exist now in the camp. They fled to a village in Idlib about two weeks ago.' Wherever they have gone, it means the family are trapped once more between three violent sides - none of which are prepared to stop until they have wiped the other off the face of the earth. Relative safety: Many of the 15,000 are headed to refugee camps like Atmeh, near the Turkish border - but it is not known where Hudea and her small family are . Civil war: Fighting has been going on Hudea's entire life, killing 10,000 children since 2011. Pictured: Atmeh, her home after he father was killed in 2012 . And living in an area recently won by one side, does not guarantee survival - or peace. A source in the Syrian military force told EA World View: 'We have an obligation to liberate the city... I swear to god the highest we are not scared.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at University of Oklahoma, was also certain Damascus would not give up without a fight. He told\u00a0Bloomberg:\u00a0'Assad will likely bomb Idlib so that its captors find little peace in their new prize.' Mr Winter thinks it is unlikely they will have gone to areas controlled by the Syrian government. One suspects the memory of what they did to her husband will mean Hudea's mother will keep her family away from al-Assad's forces. But villages not in the control of the regime have come under attack since Nusra Front's assault on Idlib - which itself sent 15,000 people fleeing for their lives. Ironically, many are making their way to the refugee camps in the north - like Atmeh, the safe haven Hudea has just left. And now there are reports of the regime using chlorine-filled bombs against the towns\u00a0surrounding\u00a0Idlib - a new horror for the little girl and her family to contend with.

Indeed, the food chain's new Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich - which is described on the Dunkin Donuts website as containing 'delicious breaded chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon and honey mustard' which are all \u00a0'served on an oven-toasted pretzel bun' - contains a whopping 640 calories, almost a third of your recommended daily intake. Additionally, the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale, which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg. The roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake. And when paired with one of Dunkin Donuts' new ice cream-inspired coffee flavors - Rocky Road Swirl, Butter Pecan Swirl, or Cookie Dough Swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal, if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee. Another option listed on the new menu is the Southwest Supreme Bagel, which is stuffed with cheese, corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes, onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake.

But while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier, low-calorie option, it still contains five grams of saturated fats, which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake. Last, but not least, the menu also contains two new varieties of Dunkin Donuts' signature Cheesecake Square Donut, which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling, this time in Oreo and raspberry flavors. And while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the Dunkin website, the standard Cheesecake Square Donut contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance. Unsurprisingly, the chain's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health-conscious Twitter users to voice their concerns over the calorie-laden choices.

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Forever 21 Metallic Satin Blazer . Visit site . Missguided Satin Lapel Longline Tuxedo Blazer (now $30) Visit site . Stella McCartney Rhea satin blazer at The Outnet (now $784) Visit site . Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.'

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "(CNN)If one is to believe lawyers for Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend, his future brother-in-law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain-smoked. The jury in the high-profile trial resumed deliberations Wednesday after deliberating about an hour-and-a-half on Tuesday. The way defense lawyer James Sultan laid it out for the Massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier Tuesday, why would a young man with a $40 million contract kill semi-pro player Odin Lloyd less than a mile from his own home? Why would Hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene? Did those who Sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the National Football League? \"If there was evidence of any reason Aaron would have had to murder Odin Loyd, don't you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks?\" Sultan asked the jury. \"You didn't hear it because it doesn't exist.\" The prosecution, however, portrayed Hernandez as cold, calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention, one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others. Prosecutor William McCauley asked jurors: What was Hernandez talking about a day after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found at a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013? \" 'My endorsements are gone,' \" Hernandez said, according to McCauley said. \"He's not talking about Odin.\" The state's largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and the presentation of more than 400 pieces of evidence. On Monday, Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story in less than a day. In closing arguments the next day, Sultan sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that Hernandez orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt. Even if they found a strong likelihood that Hernandez was involved, the lawyer said, \"That's not enough.\" Sultan tried to implicate Hernandez's co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The defense described Wallace and Ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on PCP, as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage. They're accused of killing Lloyd. \"Did he make all the right decisions? No,\" Sultan said of his client. \"He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something, committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do, so he put one foot in front of another. Keep in mind, he's not charged with accessory after the fact. ... He's charged with murder ... and that he did not do.\" The prosecution said Wallace and Ortiz were longtime friends of Hernandez, who had complete control of them. McCauley reminded the jury of testimony about Hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies, and Hernandez at times leaving his then 8-month-old child with the two men. \"These guys ... will do whatever he wants,\" the prosecutor said of Hernandez. The motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out, but prosecutors said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They said Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score. McCauley said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone -- such as disrespect -- would easily offend Hernandez. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, testified that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box. The prosecution has said the murder weapon, which has not been recovered, was in the box. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Jenkins said she threw it away in \"a random dumpster\" but could not remember where. Another piece of the state's case was grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park, which is about a mile from Hernandez's home. The video is time-stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving. Hernandez's lawyers showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand. They suggested it was an iPad. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012, almost a year before Lloyd was killed. He will be tried in that case after the Lloyd trial. The jury has not heard about the double shooting.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "Watching George Osborne enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider and a chat with the locals in a Somerset pub garden, it is hard to believe that only three years ago he was virtually scared to leave the safety of his Treasury office. He felt besieged and intimidated. There was little evidence his hardline \u2018austerity Britain\u2019 policies were working. His nervy demeanour and pallid complexion reflected the sickly economy. In the eyes of critics he was a hate figure \u2013 and it was getting to him. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically, and I got myself into a position where I was hunkered down in the Treasury,\u2019 George Osborne drinks a pint of Somerset cider as he is interviewed by Political Editor Simon Walters at The Cotley Inn, near Chard, Somerset . Osborne reflects as we chat at the Cotley Inn in Chard during a break in an Election campaign tour of the South West. \u2018I was saying, look, if people don\u2019t like the plan or whatever, well, you know\u2026 so be it.\u2019 The nadir came when the Chancellor was booed at the Paralympic Games. Worse, it happened in front of his children, Luke and Liberty, now aged 13 and 11. Did he feel he couldn\u2019t take any more? \u2018I never personally felt, erm, low,\u2019 he says slowly, giving a rare glimpse of his emotions. \u2018But I\u2019m not going to pretend it was easy. \u2018The most difficult thing was explaining it to my children \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy conversation to have.\u2019 Osborne has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the Paralympics to being credited with helping to turn Britain's economy around . Osborne did not consider throwing in the towel, but he knew that he had to break out of his Treasury bunker. \u2018I thought, hold on, you cannot do this in this job \u2013 you have to go out and explain yourself, meet people, expose yourself to fresh ideas.\u2019 He gestures with outstretched arms, hands clenched, recalling the moment he got a grip. Since then, confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the Chancellor himself. And he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically. He went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st. On the day of our interview, a national newspaper compared the new-look Osborne to dashing Latin heart-throb actor Antonio Banderas \u2013 quite a change from the days when he was derided as a Regency fop. \u2018It\u2019s definitely moving in the right direction!\u2019 he laughs. More waspish and engaging than David Cameron in private, Osborne has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public. It is one of the reasons he stood aside when Cameron ran for the Tory Party leadership. He is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat \u2013 a basic skill required by modern leaders. His sense of isolation in his early days as Chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife Frances\u2019s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in London instead of moving to Downing Street. They thought it would make it easier to preserve a \u2018normal\u2019 family life.\u00a0It did the opposite. \u2018I never saw the kids or Frances, because I was up so early and back late,\u2019 Osborne says. His morale improved dramatically when the family did move into Downing Street, one of the few U-turns Osborne has made. \u2018I see the children all the time now, in the morning, and I can pop up in the early afternoon if I\u2019m going out in the evening,\u2019 he says cheerily. \u2018I feel very lucky.\u2019 Osborne also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying Britain under Labour will mimic France's course since it voted in socialist Francois Hollande as president . Osborne\u2019s tour of the West Country has been designed to target seats where the Tories are fighting the Lib Dems. At Hawkins Garage in St Austell, Cornwall, to promote the Government\u2019s apprenticeship scheme, the Chancellor was shown by 17-year-old trainee mechanic Dale Wilkes how to drain a car sump. Osborne\u2019s hand ended up drenched in oil. If he had been asked to do it in his \u2018hunkered down\u2019 phase he would have found it torture. Here, with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls, it wasn\u2019t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as Dale passed him a spanner. From St Austell it was back to\u00a0Somerset and Yeovil, where Osborne hopes the Tory candidate will unseat Lib Dem David Laws who was, until two weeks ago, a Coalition colleague. Osborne was such a fan of Laws that when the Coalition was formed in 2010, he made Laws his deputy, stating that he was \u2018put on earth to be Treasury Chief Secretary\u2019. \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t last long in that position!\u2019 hoots Osborne with a fiendish grin. Laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an MPs\u2019 expenses scandal which led to him being painfully \u2018outed\u2019 as gay. Osborne\u2019s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem who succeeded Laws as Osborne\u2019s Treasury deputy, claimed that an unnamed \u2018very senior Tory\u2019 told him: \u2018You take care of the workers, we\u2019ll take care of the bosses.\u2019 Was it Osborne who said it, as many suspected? \u2018No,\u2019 the Chancellor snaps. But if he has rescued the economy and Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are so useless, as he always claims, why aren\u2019t the Conservatives ahead in the polls? Is it time to press the panic button? \u2018The campaign is going as we wanted it to,\u2019 he insists. Really? \u2018Yes. We always thought it would be close.\u2019 Mr Osborne said he never 'personally felt low' about being booed at the Paralympics in 2012, but had to explain it to his children . But Miliband is proving more resilient than the Tories expected. \u2018Only because he\u2019s standing behind podiums in front of Labour supporters,\u2019 he mocks. Tory MPs claim that their party\u2019s campaign lacks passion and that Cameron\u2019s Australian election guru, Lynton Crosby, is too aggressive and too powerful. Osborne stands foursquare behind them: \u2018David Cameron leads this Election campaign from the front.\u2019 It provokes him into showing some passion of his own. \u2018I\u2019m not about to hand over the keys to No 11 to Ed Balls, saying, \u201cGo and wreck all the good work we\u2019ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country.\u201d Absolutely not!\u2019 The one U-turn Osborne has made during the last five years is moving his wife Frances (pictured) and their children to No 11 Downing Street, so he can be closer to them . He says that if Labour wins, Britain will become an economic basket case like France did after socialist Francois Hollande won power. \u2018France is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour, jobs go, debts pile up. People will say, \u201cMy God, Britain is going backward instead of forward.\u201d Osborne is in his stride now, spitting venom. \u2018All this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from Labour about standing up for\u00a0the many not the few\u2026 the people who suffer most when Labour governments screw up the economy are the poorest.\u2019 A measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month Cameron named Osborne as one of three potential successors \u2013 and no one laughed. So would he like to become PM? \u2018I\u2019m not a politician who spends my life thinking, \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d and \u201cWhat when\u2026?\u201d \u2019 Rot, he can be every bit as calculating as Labour\u2019s Machiavellian Peter Mandelson, we tease him. \u2018I\u2019m not rising to that!\u2019 he laughs. Osborne was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his Tatton constituency, combining politics with a family day out. He was accompanied by Frances, a successful author and daughter of former Tory Minister Lord David Howell, and Luke and Liberty. \u2018We\u2019re all really looking forward to the Election. The children are interested in it. My son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones,\u2019 he chuckles. \u2018Then The Voice came on TV and we switched over to that.\u2019 With that, Osborne takes another sip of his Somerset cider, aptly called Thatchers Gold. It slakes Osborne\u2019s thirst for now. But he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the Tories don\u2019t win Election gold on May 7.", "claim": "george osborne was booed at the paralympic games tour of the south west. the

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement. But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home. In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business. And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo \u2013 which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses \u2013 has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors. Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s . At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire. At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat. Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale. 'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57. 'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.' He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business . The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss . He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world. 'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away \u2013 but it wasn't a problem. I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.' Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors. Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel. He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean. 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007. 'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.' The four-bedroom home is now on the market for \u00a3599,000. At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building . The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat \u2013 and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s. But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself. In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village. It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own \u2013 the very property that Branson would one day end up converting. Price: \u00a3599,000 . Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson; former Wesleyan chapel in the village where John Wesley gave his first sermon . At the time of his first sermon, Wesley was studying at Oxford University. The Jacobean pulpit in St James the Great bears a plaque commemorating the sermon, which is reputed to have lasted two-and-a-half hours. 'We were looking for a property in South Leigh as we had friends in the area,' says recently separated Rowan, 50 \u2013 a management consultant with two children, Jacob, 15, and Nancy, 13. 'We fell in love with the house the moment we saw it.' Rowan only found out Branson had been a previous owner on his second viewing. 'That undoubtedly increased our interest, especially when we realised what an excellent job he had done converting it into a home, without losing too many of its original features,' said Rowan. 'And the house ticked all the boxes for us. It has lots of space and is conveniently located for the A40, with good access to London.' At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, pictured is the kitchen . The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden . The building is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout it. Features that Branson added include pine banisters and large round windows offering views across surrounding countryside. The property has an en suite and family bathroom, and the master bedroom overlooks the back garden. A studio room could be used as an office or fifth bedroom. The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden. A kitchen and third reception room complete the accommodation. 'We have the benefit of open space, yet it is still cosy and warm due to a large woodburner in one of the reception rooms,' says Rowan. 'I'll definitely miss the place.'

When asked why, 43 per cent said they could not be bothered and 39 per cent said they did not think the value warranted the effort. Four in ten Britons have an average \u00a377 of unwanted good because they have not got round to returning it . A fifth (21 per cent) are too busy, believing that it takes nearly half an hour to return something each time, suggesting time is put ahead of hard earned cash. Confusing processes were also identified as a major deterrent to sending an item back for 22 per cent. The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer. Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items. Amongst the most commonly unreturned items were women's dresses, shoes and trousers, which occupied the top three spots. Then came women's shirts or blouses, women's jeans, electrical equipment, women's jackets, homeware, jewellery and women's underwear, according to the One Poll survey of 2,000 people.

Carol Cole was 17 years old when she disappeared without a trace after running away from a juvenile detention center in Texas in October 1980. In January 1981, police in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, found a teenage girl stabbed nine times in the back and chest stashed under a pile of leaves in the woods out of a dirt road outside Shreveport. For 34 years, Carol's family searched in vain for the troubled teen. At the same time, detectives from Bossier Parish never stopped trying to identity the body they found mutilated in the woods. Coming together: The picture at left is the image used by Carol Cole's family on Craigslist posts across Texas and Louisiana. The image at right is a rendering of 'Bossier Doe' created for a Facebook page posted by detectives in an attempt to identify a body found in January 1981 . Carol Cole escaped from a Texas juvenile jail in October 1980 after moving from Michigan with her mother. Her remains have been found and identified after 34 years . Relieved: Carol Cole's sister, Jeanie Phelps of Kalamazoo, Michigan, (center) with Bossier Sheriff's Lt. Shannon Mack and Sgt. Dave Faulk . Now, social media has brought Carol's family and Louisiana detectives together. In February, DNA confirmed that the body in Louisiana matched missing Carol's DNA, the Detroit News\u00a0reports. New attention to the case has brought forward a potential suspect, as well. John Chesson, who is already in prison for an unrelated murder, is named as a person of interest in Carol's brutal death . Carol's sister Jeanie Phelps\u00a0and her friend posted Craigslist ads across Texas and Louisiana with pictures of the teen, hoping someone might recognize her. At the same time, Bossier Parish Lieutenant Shannon Mack crated a Facebook post for 'Bossier Doe' (Facebook doesn't allow Jane Doe page names). It included a digitally-rendered drawing of the victim based on her skeletal remains. Carol's family aznd Bossier detectives made a connection six days later when Bossier Parish 911 dispatcher Linda Erickson was trolling through Craigslist. Long road: Cole, from Michigan, was eventually found dead in Louisiana. She was last heard from in December 1980 and found dad a month later . These are the shoes that Carol was wearing when she was found dead. Police posted pictures of them in the hopes of jogging the memory of anyone who may have known her . Person of interest: John Chesson has been identified as a possible suspect by his own daughter. He's currently in prison for an unrelated murder . She had seen the Facebook page posted by detectives in her department. When she stumbled across Ms Phelps' Craigslist page, she realized that the rendering of Bossier Doe and picture of Carol looked remarkably similar. 'I can't explain it other than this child was meant to have an identity,' Ms Erikson tells the News. Perhaps even more remarkable, authorities in Bossier and Carol's family had crossed each other's paths some 30 years ago in a failed attempt to find the teen and identify the body. A coroner in the early 1980s examined the remains to see whether they matched Carol's description - but he said they weren't close enough for further investigation. Ms Phelps, Carol's sister, also considered the Bossier remains in the search for her missing sister - but says she must have glossed over them, WOOD-TV reports. All the new attention has also brought forward a potential suspect in Carol's murder. \u00a0Convicted murderer John Chesson's own daughter told the News that media coverage of Carol's case jogged her memories that the teen had been staying at their house in 1980 before she disappeared. Frances LeBlanc says that her father was a violent, abusive man. And he was also the one who claimed to have found Carol's body in the woods and alerted police. Detectives have not filed charges, but say they are investigating whether Chesson murdered the teenager nearly 35 years ago.

The area is famous for its stunning rock formations, deep valleys and ancient subterranean hideouts, which have been carved from volcanic ash rock. The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scroll down for video . Builders in Turkey have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of Cappadocia. \u00a0The city lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress (pictured). Three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen, leading to vast, winding tunnels . The subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of Earth. It lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress and the surrounding area, which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (TOK\u0130). The multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, according to a report in National Geographic. The find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement. A view of the underground city newly discovered in Turkey's Central Anatolian province of Nevsehir, which is famous for fairy chimney rock formations. The city was built from volcanic ash rock . The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scientists have yet to discover all its secret passages . Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.' The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material. The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks. The latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement. Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances. Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances. It had areas for sleeping, stables, wells, kitchens, ventilation shafts, tombs, communal rooms, bathrooms. Like Derinkuyu, the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders, but remains largely unexplored. But this city is far larger, with early estimates suggesting it could be around a third bigger than Derinkuyu. Geophysicists from Nev\u015fehir University recently conducted a systematic study of a 1.5 mile (4 km) area using geophysical resistivity and seismic tomography. The studies suggest the underground corridors may go as deep as 371ft (113 metres), but the exact size remains unknown. Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.'

In her Instagram post she called the Oscar-winning actress 'sexy' and noted that her husband of two years took a gander at her cleavage, writing: '#WhereAreThoseEyesWanderingReynolds #HelenMirrenIStheSexiestWomanAlive #WomanInGold.' Speaking to People, Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. 'You know, he makes a girl feel good,' she explained. 'Some guys don't.

The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush\u2019s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush\u2019s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was \u2018crazy\u2019 with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova\u2019s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest:\u00a0\u2018We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.\u2019 Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of \u00a373,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years.

Ms Kukucova had given herself up in her home town which is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Spain . 'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than \u00a359,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom. He said: 'I am sure that it will not be easy to sell this house - at least not for that money.'

Despite Wolves bouncing back to take a point through Benik Afobe's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a Richard Stearman own goal had given Ipswich a first-half lead, Town's play-off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining. Former Wolves boss McCarthy was delighted with his side's determined display and he said: 'It was a good performance and a good point. It is very pleasing. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were denied three points as rivals Wolves fought back to draw 1-1 on Saturday . 'Wolves were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great, stubborn, belligerent, professional performance - all those horrible words people don't like in football but I do because you win games and win leagues by doing that. 'We are always hard to beat and hard to play against. 'The first thing I said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent, stubborn, hard working, tough, horrible bunch you have turned out to be and I love you and I am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team. It is lovely to have. 'A lot of those qualities are probably the reasons why we are where we are. 'It takes a lot of things to be in the top six and there will be teams below us who are all playing sexy football but we are winning games and we are in the top six and we still have a chance of being promoted. 'So to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it I laugh at them and think it is comical because I think what we do we do well and isn't that what having a job is all about?' Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal . McCarthy, who was sacked by Wolves in February 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club, insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to Molineux. He added: 'I think I am very much liked and respected by the Wolves fans and I love the club and the people here so I don't think I have got anything to prove and I always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back. 'But I have taken the point and I am happy with that.' Although they trailed at the break, Wolves needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when Afobe stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with Nouha Dicko carrying their greatest. McCarthy hails the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of Ipswich players . They could not find a second goal, though, and their play-off hopes are now hanging by a thread. However, coach Kenny Jackett insisted they will not be throwing in the towel. He said: 'It is out of our hands and now we will need to win our final two games and other teams will need to lose. But you don't know what will happen. So we need to make sure that we go again next week. 'It is a tough call, we understand that. We will have to see how the table looks but one way or another we have to put in a good performance and give it everything we have got next week at Wigan. Kenny Jackett is still hopeful his Wolves side can secure a Championship play-off spot despite the 1-1 draw . 'If the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there.' He added: 'We gave it everything against Ipswich. I thought that we showed a lot of spirit, effort and energy in the second half when we pushed Ipswich all the way. The attitude and tempo was there.' 'Ultimately it is a better point for Ipswich than it is for us. We needed to win and I felt that we built up very well in the second half. We got a goal back early on but couldn't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute Ipswich defence.

'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn\u2019t make me think she will rebound from this.

Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026 with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports. When the bar shuts at 2am, the private towing company, Advanced Towing, within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot. The firm showed\u00a0magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to\u00a0suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 0, "document": "(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.", "claim": "cnn hero of the year has been warned not to use main water line to risk of cholera. koirala's group is home to 115 girls of sex trafficking. all of the children have been sleeping.", "cnndm_id": "dae2675302d92bdf0bbd6d35c3e473389f8bb5a1", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal.", "And they are struggling in the aftermath.", "Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls.", "While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12.", "The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry.", "\"We are suffering with rain, strong wind.", "The fear is not gone from us.", "It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year.", "The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera.", "Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food.", "Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster.", "\"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said.", "\"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse.", "Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything.", "...", "If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\"", "About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled.", "Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard.", "\"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said.", "\"Everything is broken in the hospice.\"", "Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged.", "\"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said.", "\"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it.", "I was not afraid that I was going to be killed.", "I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\"", "Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence.", "They are now living on the ground in a nearby field.", "\"Physically, we are not hurt.", "But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated.", "Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down.", "She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves.", "\"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said.", "\"We are really scared.\"", "They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says.", "But she is trying to stay positive.", "\"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?

Claims: Richard Kerr, 53, said he was abused by \u2018powerful people\u2019 in a Westminster paedophile ring . His account provides the first clear link between three alleged major VIP paedophile rings that operated in London and Northern Ireland. And the claims will add weight to calls for the allegations about the Irish children\u2019s home to be covered by the official abuse inquiry now being chaired by judge Lowell Goddard. Mr Kerr told how he suffered abuse at Kincora children\u2019s home in Belfast, where victims have accused MI5 of blocking police inquiries. He said he and two other boys were then trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse in two locations. He said he endured his most violent ordeal at Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London.

Eddie Hearn presents the cheque for \u00a31.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Matchroom Sport boss Hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight . Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' TV rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as Matchroom are tied to Sky Sports, while Frampton\u2019s recent title defence against Chris Avalos attracted millions of viewers between ITV in the UK and UTV Ireland. Now Hearn has seemingly attempted to force the fight with a big-money offer in the hope that the bout can be screened on Sky Box Office. While past negotiations were believed to have collapsed due to a failure to agree a deal on future promotional \u2018options\u2019 on fights, the Matchroom promoter also insisted he has not demanded rights to promote Frampton\u2019s future fights. \u2018Nothing at all \u2014 no options, no rematch clause, absolutely nothing,\u2019 Hearn told Sportsmail when questioned on whether such terms were included in his \u00a31.5m offer. \u2018He can have this fight, he can go back to whatever broadcaster he wants [after it]. He can go and move to the moon if he wants, it\u2019s nothing to do with us.\u2019 Quigg is the defending WBA super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight Frampton in Manchester . Quigg celebrates his win over Hidenori Othake at the Liverpool Echo Arena in November last year . McGuigan declined to comment further on the saga when contacted by Sportsmail, refusing to elaborate on Cyclone Promotions\u2019 statement which said they \u2018have made several attempts to organise a follow-up meeting with Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport to progress these negotiations\u2019. The Cyclone statement added: \u2018If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.\u2019 Hearn countered the Cyclone statement, telling Sportsmail: \u2018We just want to get it done, it\u2019s so frustrating\u2026 I know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that\u2019s because it was getting nowhere. We\u2019re trying to make things happen. \u2018The only thing that Cyclone Promotions want is they want to co-promote the show. We\u2019re bringing all the money, we\u2019re putting all the money up,\u2019 said the Matchroom promoter. \u2018If there was another broadcaster that they were willing to work with, who could throw a load of money at this fight, then make us an offer. They can\u2019t. We\u2019re in such a strong position, but we\u2019re still being fair. Scott Quigg is the one taking all the risk here. If it doesn\u2019t do that great at the box office, Scott might get only \u00a3400-500,000 and Carl still gets his \u00a31.5m, there is no risk. 'This is the offer that I believe has to make Carl Frampton say yes. I\u2019ve already responded [to Cyclone] to say \u201cif you want to co-promote, co-promote it\u201d,\u2019 added Hearn.

The blue Audi pulls out from Whitchurch road, in Chester and accelerates into the side of the bus . It then collides into the bus as part of the \u00a31million 'crash for cash' scam that took place over three years . The elaborate fraud allowed passengers on the bus, who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam, to falsely claim from insurers . Smith, the managing director of Swift Accident Solutions, stage-managed the crashes around the Chester area over the three-year period, in a bid to create new claimants for his business. He then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than \u00a31million - to no win no fee lawyers. All of the bogus claims submitted by the Smith's company were for whiplash and 'soft tissue injuries,' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies. Instead, insurers were forced to rely on the individual claimants and usually settled out of court. John Smith (right), 45, from Connah's Quay, North Wales is facing jail after stage-managing several collisions in a \u00a31m 'crash for cash' fraud; Luke McQuillan (left) was found guilty of\u00a0of conspiracy to commit fraud . Police uncovered Smith's plot after being alerted by First Direct insurance to the unusually high volume of claims. They also found more than 90 per cent\u00a0of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another. The majority were friends or relatives of the 12 defendants, the court was told. The court heard how Smith had introduced 177 new claimants to a lawyer for which he received \u00a3960 each time. Investigators later found that the bogus claims accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total gross income at Swift Accident Solutions during the period. Smith was convicted yesterday at Manchester Crown Court Smith of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, following a 41-day trial. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud. Four more people had already pleaded guilty to the charge, while two defendants were found not guilty.\u00a0Police believe more arrests will still be made over the scam. During the trial, the court was told how Smith masterminded the scam by finding drivers who were willing to carry out a fake crash. More than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another and were mainly said to be friends and relatives of the 12 defendants. Pictured: Richard Flynn (left) and Barry Cooper (right) were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud following the 41-day trial at Manchester Crown Court . The drivers would then pull out at low speed, using vehicles provided by Smith, and collide with the buses. The single and double decker buses had been chosen out of 'greed' because of the sheer number of claims that could be lodged, the court was told. Bus driver John Griffths told the court how he was caught up in one of the accidents while driving a park and ride bus towards Chester in June 2011. He told how he broke gently when he saw the Rover car pulling out of the side road, in a bid to prevent his standing passengers from being flung along the aisle. He added: 'I couldn't brake harshly because I had standing passengers, if I'd have done that they would have gone forward, so I had to go gently. The driver of the car said it was his fault, that his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator.' But he said one woman quickly reported that she 'wasn't feeling well'. He was also approached by three men, one of whom claimed he had hurt his leg on the bus steps, despite having no visible sign of injury. Nine other defendants, who police said played a major role in organising the collisions, were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud including Dean Brown, 42, (left) and Barry Cooper, 35 (right) When an ambulance was called to the scene, treatment was declined, he added. A passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the Rover driver, at a side junction, actually looking at the bus just before to the collision. Although there was a 'minimal jolt', a fellow passenger was overheard exclaiming 'oh my back', he said. Smith was also accused of making a false representation by not declaring two outstanding county court judgments when applying for a licence to operate his claims management business. After the case Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale from Chester CID said the force would continue to investigate the case. He said: 'This was an extremely complex investigation spanning nearly three years and involving a large number of defendants. 'It has been a challenging process for all officers involved and has required considerable professional skills in relation to the investigation and the subsequent prosecution. 'As part of our investigation conducted a significant number of interviews, to gather the required evidence to prove that Smith and his associates had stage these collisions for the sole purpose of financial gain. 'The crime that they committed was not a victimless crime, had all of the false claims created by Smith and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been over \u00a31 million, which would have been paid for by law abiding citizens through their car insurance policies.' Det Con Stephen Owens added: 'The Police have a duty to protect life, and although these collisions were all minor, they could have been much more serious. 'Yet despite the fact all of the collisions were minor, with minimal damage to both vehicles, they all resulted in multiple claims for personal injury claims, with the vast majority of these claims submitted via Smiths company. The trial at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard how the elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being deliberately driven into the side of buses so 'injured' passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives in on the scam - could falsely claim from insurers . 'Through our investigations and the evidence we have gathered, we have been able to identify a \"passenger Network\" which shows that a large proportion of the claimants can be linked to each other. This network proves that over 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions are linked to each other. 'Although the trial against these defendants has now concluded, we will continue to investigate this case and further arrests are likely.' Other defendants found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud were: Charlotte Watts, 28, from Wrexham; Daniel Shaw, 27, from Blacon, Chester; Dean Brown, 42, from Chester; Luke McQuillan, 40, from Blacon; Michael Gentile, 45, from Chester; Sean Kettyle, 43, from Ellesmere Port; Richard Flynn, 48, from Connah\u2019s Quay; Andrew Shaw, 57, from Rodsham and Barry Cooper, 35, from Connah\u2019s Quay.

{"filename": "test_gehrmann18_org.json", "label": 1, "document": "Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was \u2018heavily geared\u2019 towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start \u2018shedding\u2019 jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could \u2018go stale\u2019 with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 \u2013 and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a \u2018job for life\u2019 meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly \u2018reskill\u2019 and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: \u2018The old model of training in youth and a \"career for life\" thereafter no longer applies\u2019. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master\u2019s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a \u2018lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks\u2019. Education:\u00a0A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification .

The spectacular isolated fort, one of three guarding the entrance to the Solent, just off the coast of the Isle of Wight, has been turned into a luxury impregnable haven complete with a rooftop hot tub, shops and even its own nightclub, thanks to a multi-million pound revamp. The unique hotel looks like could be a fortress of a James Bond villain and can sleep 44 guests with a capacity of 200 for parties and events. Scroll down for video . For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck for ocean views . The No Man's Fort has been transformed by AmaZing Venues to become a luxury hotel, and is set to open on April 23 . With four floors packed with a variety of entertaining facilities, it\u2019s a unique location that\u2019s sure to leave guests with unforgettable memories . The sea fort is located 2km out at sea, meaning guests have to make an exciting entrance by helicopter or by boat. On arrival at the ocean hotspot, guests can hit up the shops, restaurants, luxury spa, rooftop bar and firepit, cabaret bar, nightclub or LaZer Battle Arena. If water sports are more your style this is the perfect base for enjoying\u00a0RIB rides, jet biking, sea kayaking, or kite surfing. A spokesman for AmaZing Venues said: 'No Man's Fort is an inspiring private island that offers an unrivalled experience. 'It is three times the size of Spitbank Fort and boasts its own lighthouse with spectacular views across the Solent. 'You'd think being a mile offshore is unique enough, but we've crammed every possible space with unusual things to see and experience. Built between 1867 and 1880, No Man's Fort was one of several forts ordered by then-Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to fend off the French Navy. It needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. At the time it cost \u00a3462,500 to build, which with inflation would be equivalent to more than \u00a343million today. It was the first fort in England, and possibly Europe, to use hydraulic power to move the guns in horizontal and vertical planes for targeting and the first to be lighted throughout with electricity. The fort was in active use by the military up to 1957 - housing anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War - and became a scheduled ancient monument in 1967. A developer bought it in 1987 to convert it into a luxury residence but failed to find a millionaire buyer. Birmingham businessman Harmesh Pooni bought it to run as as a corporate hospitality venue but he ran into financial difficulties and had to close down. He eventually barricaded himself inside until he was removed. The fort eventually sold in 2009 for just \u00a3910,000. 'The potential of this magnificent sea fortress is only restrained by your imagination. 'A trip to the fort can be as relaxing or action-packed as you wish. 'For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck.' Described on the website as '75,000 sq ft of fun,' adventurers can unwind overlooking the spectacular rooftop views, whilst enjoying a BBQ, before retiring to one of the 23 luxury suites which cost \u00a3450 per night. Those who have the means to splash out on the best suite in the fort, the plush lighthouse facilities can cost \u00a31,150 a night during the summer. Bond villain haven! The modern fort has two helipad zones, as well as offering roof top BBQ facilities for an ocean-facing meal . Do not disturb! The fort boasts 23 luxury suites and can sleep 44 guests, with prices ranging from \u00a3450 per night . A room with a view! Not only does this hotel offer one of the most private hotel stays, but also incredible ocean views . The unusual destination boasts a colourful history and was even featured in the 1971 Dr Who episode, The Sea Devils, with Jon Pertwee. Built between 1867 and 1880, it was originally used to defend the coast against French invasion, and was used during both world wars to protect Portsmouth Harbour from attacks. In order to construct the impressive fort, huge blocks of granite were transported by barge to the site, and were lowered onto the seabed for its foundations. Luxury loo! The hotel has been renovated with many modern activities and facilities for guests to have a comfortable and memorable stay . Views above the atrium roof are spectacular, and guests can enjoy a meal on the roof overlooking the beautiful coast off the Isle of Wight . The thick 60ft-high concrete walls mean guests can rest easy knowing the fort can withstand any ocean waves crashing again its sides. While it would have cost about \u00a3462,500 to build when it was first created, inflation would equate to that figure being closer to \u00a343million today.

Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. \"If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,\" Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. RiskyLiberal tweeted: \"Dear #MemoriesPizza. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion.\" \"Don't threaten #MemoriesPizza\" tweeted A\u10e6anda. \"Just mock them for their ignorance.\" Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. \"Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA!!\" said Rob Katz of Indianapolis.  \"Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business.\" Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. \"Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?\" Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton Police Department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton. A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads \"bigots.\" Jason Narducy bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out, WBND reported. \"Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?\" Narducy asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. \"Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses,\" said a tweet from Victor Nikki. \"What's happening to #MemoriesPizza isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob,\" tweeted Savannah. \"Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere.\" Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is \"to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith,\" according to  Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. \"That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual,\" Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. \"You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be.\" Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

The unseasonably high temperatures last week saw highs of more than 25C (77F) in the South East - nearly double the average for this time of year. And forecasters warned that initial figures suggest that so far this month Britain has only seen 35 per cent of the average rainfall for April. The dry spell follows months of below-average rainfall and conditions are not expected to bring significant showers before May's arrival. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said: \u2018We are over halfway through the month but we've had around a third of the rainfall we get on average. \u2018Over the next week temperatures are going to stay above average for most parts of the country, with the high pressure lasting until the weekend.\u2019 Weather data for the year so far shows national rain fall has been significantly lower than average nearly every month.

Louis van Gaal's side have beaten Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks to enhance their chances of finishing in the top four and changing what looked like a difficult first campaign for the Dutchman into a relatively successful one. After a memorable 4-2 win over local rivals and reigning champions City on Sunday, United face a stern examination at Stamford Bridge. Gary Neville believes Manchester United have a good chance of beating Chelsea with the form they're in . Neville knows United have played well in recent weeks but admits Van Gaal's system and squad will be pushed to the limit against a Chelsea side looking to move one step closer to the title. 'The tests have been Liverpool and City,' he told Press Association Sport. 'This is another test. They have proven themselves, but this is the best team in the country and to go to Stamford Bridge is the toughest test. Louis van Gaal's side have performed admirably this season and are all but guaranteed Champions League . 'The performances from United in the past month have been absolutely outstanding in any season. 'Forget the fact that in this season they are not going to win the league, in any season the level of performance they have shown in this last month has been of a hard standard.'

It has worked really well and the players looked comfortable in the system. 'He said at the start of the season that his team would get better, they always get better and he has stuck to his word.
